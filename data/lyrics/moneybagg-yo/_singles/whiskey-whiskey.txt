[Intro: Moneybagg Yo]
Another shot, she'll love me again
(
Run that back, Turbo
)
Haha, make it a double

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Moneybagg Yo]
Whiskey, whiskey, won’t you go away?
Come again some other day
'Cause her memory came out to play
And I'm tired of it, tired of it
I don’t wanna wonder where she been (Where she at?)
She was here, now she gone again (Need her back)
Now it's me and all my whiskey friends
And I'm tired of it (Hey), tired of it (Yeah, speak)

[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo]
Dark brown skin, caught eye contact while walkin' in (On the walk up)
Perfect timing, get beside me, now we lockin' in (Linked in)
She like, "Tell me how you want it, on the rocks again (What else?)
Lil' salt around the rim (Okay), filled to the top again?" (Let's go)
Fell back, now I'm back in it
Del Dia shots got me sinning
Big racks, but these jeans skinny
Plain Richard Mille square business (Boss)
See me in the club two-steppin’
Diamonds ’round my neck square-dancing
You done made a gangster romantic
Fiendin' for your love, I’m an addict (Ayy)
So addicted, ain't nothin' we can do about it (Nah)
Country motherfucker, I say, "What's up?" she say, "Howdy" (Howdy)
Call you my lil’ cowgirl how you ride it like a stallion (Uh, uh)
Don't know why I love it
Can't get tired of it (I'm on you bad)

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Moneybagg Yo]
Whiskey, whiskey, won't you go away?
Come again some other day
'Cause her memory came out to play
And I'm tired of it, tired of it
I don't wanna wonder where she been (Where she at?)
She was here, now she gone again (Need her back)
Now it's me and all my whiskey friends
And I'm tired of it, tired of it

[Verse 2: Morgan Wallen]
Put you up and hide you on the shelf, I swear I'm through with you
You so hard to leave alone, it's always something new with you
Ain't no way to get her gone, gone, gone
So I guess I'm gonna tie one on
She's so cold, I had to go and pour you over ice
Way you got me locked down, you'd think whiskey was my wife
You so good, I had to take you home and hit it twice
Two of you gon' keep me up all night

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Moneybagg Yo]
Whiskey, whiskey, won't you go away?
Come again some other day
'Cause her memory came out to play
And I'm tired of it, tired of it
I don't wanna wonder where she been (Where she at?)
She was here, now she gone again (Need her back)
Now it's me and all my whiskey friends
And I'm tired of it, tired of it

[Outro: Morgan Wallen]
And I'm tired of it, tired of it
