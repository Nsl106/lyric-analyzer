[Verse 1: Joshua Jones, Meghan Linsey]
Your lips are moving but I can't hear you
Wish you would talk your way right over here
I see you looking, boy, but I can't feel you
Why don't we just disappear? Yeah
I'm getting jealous of the way he's leaning
You make him feel like it's all alright
Boy, if you wanna know the things I've been thinking (Haha)
You'd be meeting me outside (Alright)

[Chorus: Both]
'Cause last night, I was calling you mine
Discovering each other 'til the morning light
And I don't know where this is going
But it sure feels right
I don't wanna leave you here tonight
So let's do what we did last night, again (Mm-mm)

[Verse 2: Joshua Jones & Meghan Linsey]
Your friends are looking like they're ready for leaving
Girl, you look like you can't make up your mind
I'm fumbling, acting like I can't find my keys
Well, maybe you could give me a ride, yeah (Yeah)

[Chorus: Both]
'Cause last night, I was calling you mine
Discovering each other 'til the morning light
And I don't know where this is going
But it sure feels right
I don't wanna leave you here tonight
So let's do what we did last night, again (Mm-mm)
Yeah-yeah-yeah

[Bridge: Both]
I can't wait, I can't let you go
I can't wait, I won't let you go
Let you go

[Chorus: Both]
'Cause last night, I was calling you mine
Discovering each other 'til the morning light
And I don't know where this is going
But it sure feels right
I don't wanna leave you here tonight
So let's do what we did last night, again
Yeah-yeah-yeah, woo
Yeah-yeah-yeah

[Outro: Joshua Jones, Both]
Your lips are moving, but I can't hear you
Wish you would talk your way right over here
