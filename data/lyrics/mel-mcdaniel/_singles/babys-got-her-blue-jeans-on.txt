[Verse 1]
Down on the corner by the traffic light
Everybody's looking as she walks by
They turn their heads and they watch her 'til she's gone
Lord have mercy, baby's got her blue jeans on

[Verse 2]
Up by the bus stop and across the street
Open up their windows to take a peek
Y'all she goes walking, rockin' like a rollin' stone
Heaven help us, baby's got her blue jeans on

[Chorus]
She can't help it if she's made that way
She's not to blame if they look her way
She ain't really trying to cause a scene
It just comes naturally, ah Lord the girl can't help it

[Verse 3]
Well up on Main Street by the taxi stand
There's a crowd of people and a traffic jam
But she don't look back, she ain't doing nothing wrong
Lord have mercy, baby's got her blue jeans on

[Chorus]
She can't help it if she's made that way
She's not to blame if they look her way
She ain't really trying to cause a scene
It just comes naturally, awww the girl can't help it

[Verse 4]
Down on the corner by the traffic light
Everybody's looking as she walks by
They turn their heads and they watch her 'til she's gone
Lord have mercy, baby's got her blue jeans on
