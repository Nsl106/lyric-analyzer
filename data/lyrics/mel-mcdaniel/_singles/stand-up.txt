Ever had a hot date, one a those can't wait
Things go a little too far
In the middle of a good night have you ever got right
In the back seat of your car?

I said, stand up, have you ever been there?
Stand up, identify
Stand up, tell us all about it
Stand up, testify

Ever met a woman, late night roamin'
Party 'til your money was gone
A smiling Mona Lisa, loaded up your visa
And took a bartender home

I said, stand up if you ever been there
Stand up, identify
Stand up, tell us all about it
Stand up, testify

Thought I was a He-Man, do it just for me, man
Knew just what to do
Thought I was a hero, she rated me a zero
Said, "Honey, child you ain't through"

I said, stand up, have you ever been there?
Stand up, identify
Stand up, tell us all about it
Stand up, testify

Stand up, have you ever been there?
Stand up, identify
Stand up, tell us all about it
Stand up, testify

Stand up if you ever been there
Stand up, identify
Stand up, tell us all about it
Stand up, y'all testify

Stand up
