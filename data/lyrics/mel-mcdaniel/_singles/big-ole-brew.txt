Well, I work like devil she have to plan on the work on the outside
And I'd like rather be back home making love to my new bride
It ain't hard to think home won't back my double advice
That's a big ole brew and a little ole you

Now I know you're workin' every day just as hard as I do
Ever didn't think that I'd love you but I wouldn't say that I'll do
And it's only two things in the world that I need to get close to
That's a big ole brew and a little ole you

Well, I got both things to meet in the middle
But it can't seem to get 'em tide
I don't care long as I know you'd be by my side

Well, I got both things to meet in the middle
But it can't seem to get 'em tide
I don't care long as I know you'd be by my side

When I ain't gonna work as hard every day in my lifetime
One of these days every thing that I want's gonna be mine
But it ain't that'll be all right as long as their sunshine
And a big ole brew and a little ole you

I'll take a big ole brew, I'll take a little ole you
