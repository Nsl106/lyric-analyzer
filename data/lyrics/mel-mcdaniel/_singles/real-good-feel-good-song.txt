[Verse 1]
Did you ever wake up in the morning, nothing was a-goin' right?
Spent the whole night fussin' and a-fightin' with your wife?
Bills out in the mailbox you know that you can't pay
Then you try to leave for work and your car's been hauled away?

[Chorus]
What you needed was a real good, feel-good song
One that makes you feel alright when everything goes wrong
One that makes you move your feet and makes you sing along
You need a real good, feel-good song

[Verse 2]
A friend of mine was a-workin' hard, savin' all his pay
Like Jesse James, the IRS stole most of it away
Then he got chased by a street gang and he finally found a phone
He called up the police and they put him on hold

[Chorus]
What you needed was a real good, feel-good song
One that makes you feel alright when everything goes wrong
One that makes you move your feet and makes you sing along
You need a real good, feel-good song

[Bridge]
They say music charms the savage beast and I believe it's true
Man's had it down through history when he's had the blues
He'd find a drum to beat on and a horn that he could blow
You know it worked for the children of Israel at the walls of Jericho

[Chorus]
They brought the house down with a real good, feel-good song
One that makes you feel alright when everything goes wrong
One that makes you move your feet and makes you sing along
You need a real good, feel-good song
You need a real good, feel-good song
One that makes you feel alright when everything goes wrong
One that makes you move your feet and makes you sing along
You need a real good, feel-good song
You need a real good, feel-good song
