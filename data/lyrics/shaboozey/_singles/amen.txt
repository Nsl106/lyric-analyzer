[Verse 1: Shaboozey]
On a lost and lonely highway, payin' for my sins
If heaven saw me out last Friday, hell, I ain't gettin' in
I'm getting used to gettin' sideways 'til I can't see straight
Them angels know they don't look my way
I'm way too gone to save
I'm diggin' my grave, down, 12 feet deep
Got nothin' left so I'm on my knees beggin'

[Chorus: Shaboozey]
Somebody say a prayer for me
'Cause the pills ran out and I still can't sleep (Hey)
Somebody send a word upstairs
'Cause the bar's shut down and I'm God knows where
Forced to knock on Heaven's door
'Cause mine ain't workin' anymore
Somebody say a prayer for me
All I'm askin' for is a little mercy, Amen

[Post-Chorus: Shaboozey]
Ayy-ayy-ayy
Ayy-ayy-ayy-Amеn
Ayy-ayy-ayy
Ayy-ayy-ayy-Amen

[Verse 2: Jelly Roll]
In a dusty Silverado, runnin' low on grace
Hеading nowhere fast with my feet up on the dash
Just hopin' I see the day
I ain't ashamed of the man in the mirror
And the man upstairs ain't either
And I can finally set my life straight
And be the man my mama raised
Instead of diggin' my grave, down, 12 feet deep
I got nothin' left so I'm on my knees singin'

[Chorus: Shaboozey & Jelly Roll]
Somebody say a prayer for me
'Cause the pills ran out and I still can't sleep
Somebody send a word upstairs
'Cause the bar's shut down and I'm God knows where
Forced to knock on Heaven's door
'Cause mine ain't workin' anymore
Somebody say a prayer for me
All I'm askin' for is a little mercy, Amen

[Post-Chorus: Shaboozey]
Ayy-ayy-ayy
Ayy-ayy-ayy-Amen
Ayy-ayy-ayy (Somebody say, somebody say)
Ayy-ayy-ayy-Amen

[Bridge: Shaboozey & Jelly Roll]
Somebody say a prayer for me
(Ayy) Amen
Somebody say a prayer for me

[Chorus: Shaboozey & Jelly Roll]
Somebody say a prayer for me
'Cause the pills ran out and I still can't sleep
Somebody send a word upstairs
'Cause the bar's shut down and I'm God knows where
Forced to knock on Heaven's door
'Cause mine ain't workin' anymore
Somebody say a prayer for me
All I'm askin' for is a little mercy, Amen

[Outro: Shaboozey]
Ayy-ayy-ayy (Somebody say)
Ayy-ayy-ayy-Amen (Somebody say a prayer for me)
Ayy-ayy-ayy (Somebody say)
Ayy-ayy-ayy-Amen (Somebody say a prayer for me)
Ayy-ayy-ayy
Ayy-ayy-ayy-Amen
Ayy-ayy-ayy
Ayy-ayy-ayy-Amen
