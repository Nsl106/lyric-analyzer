[Verse 1]
Man, what a hell of a year it's been
Keep on bluffin', but I just can't win
Drowned my sorrows, but they learned to swim
Man, what a hell of a year it's been
Head in a bottle, but my heart in a case
It's gettin' harder to act my age
Play a sad song on a tiny violin
For the man at the bar confessin' his sins

[Chorus]
I need some good news
Sittin' here, sippin' on cold truth
Nobody knows what I'm goin' through
Bet the devil wouldn't walk in my shoes
Wish someone told me
Livin' this life would be lonely
Tryna get away from the old me
Still stuck singin' these blues
All I really need is a little good news

[Verse 2]
Love keeps knockin', but I just ain't home
Ain't pickin' no flowers from the seeds that I've sown
They say it gets darker when you're coverin' them doors
Still lookin' for the right at the end of my wrongs
At the end of my wrongs

[Chorus]
I need some good news
Sittin' here, sippin' on cold truth
Nobody knows what I'm goin' through
Bet the devil wouldn't walk in my shoes
Wish someone told me
Livin' this life would be lonely
Tryna get away from the old me
Still stuck singin' these blues
All I really need is a little good news

[Post-Chorus]
Is a little good news
Ooh, oh
Oh

[Chorus]
I need some good news
Sittin' here, sippin' on cold truth
Nobody knows what I'm goin' through
Bet the devil wouldn't walk in my shoes
Wish someone told me
Livin' this life would be lonely
Tryna get away from the old me
Still stuck singin' these blues
All I really need is a little good news

[Outro]
All I really need is a little—
Somethin' bring me back to the middle
All I really need is a little good news
