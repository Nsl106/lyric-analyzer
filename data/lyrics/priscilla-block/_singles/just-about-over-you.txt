[Verse 1]
I've stopped looking for your truck
Every time I go somewhere
I don't scroll through the past anymore 'cause I don't care
I'm finally putting on the shirt I like
Tight jeans, big hoops with my hair up high
The least you could've done was give me the bar tonight

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to come back in right then
Right when I was just getting good and gone?
Guess I was in the wrong place at the wrong time
You must've heard I was moving on
Then right out of the blue
A quarter past 2, I'm all about you
When I was just about, just about over you
I was just about, just about over you

[Verse 2]
You could've stayed with the guys, acting like you didn't see me
It would've hurt a little less if you'd bought some girl a drink
But you had to walk up, messing me up
I'm drunk, wondering why it's gotta be like this
I thought that I was moving on, but now I'm starting back over again

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to come back in right then
Right when I was just getting good and gone
Guess I was in the wrong place at the wrong time
You must've heard I was moving on
Then right out of the blue
A quarter past 2, I'm all about you
When I was just about, just about over you
I was just about, just about over you

[Bridge]
Maybe you caught me on a bad night
Maybe tomorrow I'll be just fine
Maybe it's the red wine
That put you back in my mind

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to come back in right then
Right when I was just getting good and gone?
Guess I was in the wrong place at the wrong time
You must've heard I was moving on
Then right out of the blue
A quarter past 2, I'm all about you
When I was just about, just about over you, oh-oh
I was just about over you
