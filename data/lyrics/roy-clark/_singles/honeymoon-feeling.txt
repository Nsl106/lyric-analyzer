I still get that honeymoon feeling
After all these years my heart goes reeling
Every time you touch me it's the living end
I still get that honeymoon feeling
I can still hear those wedding bells ringing
Every time we love I get that honeymoon feeling again

It seems like only yesterday you walked into my life
And answered all my prayers and made my dreams come true
And even though it's been some time since I made you my wife
Every day I find I'm even more in love with you

I still get that honeymoon feeling
After all these years my heart goes reeling
Every time you touch me it's the living end
I still get that honeymoon feeling
I can still hear those wedding bells ringing
Every time we love I get that honeymoon feeling again

I'm thankful that I wake up with an angel by my side
You make my world a better place to be
And though were far from newlyweds you're still my brushing bride
But most of all I'm glad you show just how much you need me

I still get that honeymoon feeling
After all these years my heart goes reeling
Every time you touch me it's the living end
I still get that honeymoon feeling
I can still hear those wedding bells ringing
Every time we love I get that honeymoon feeling again

I still get that honeymoon feeling
After all these years my heart goes reeling
Every time you touch me it's the living end
I still get that honeymoon feeling
I can still hear those wedding bells ringing
Every time we love I get that honeymoon feeling again...
