We're not as young as we used to be
But baby I don't mind
'Cause growing with you is gonna be
Full of life and good times

And if I had it to do all over again I'd do it with you
I won't want to miss a thing that we've been through
Baby nothing can compare with the good love that we've shared
And if I had to do it all over again I'd do it with you

Looking back on life I can't complain
It ain't been easy but don't you know
We still had sunshine even when it rained
And we've shared a love you have known

And if I had it to do all over again I'd do it with you
I won't want to miss a thing that we've been through
Baby nothing can compare with the good love that we've shared
And if I had to do it all over again I'd do it with you

And if I had it to do all over again I'd do it with you
I won't want to miss a thing that we've been through
Baby nothing can compare with the good love that we've shared
And if I had to do it all over again I'd do it with you...
