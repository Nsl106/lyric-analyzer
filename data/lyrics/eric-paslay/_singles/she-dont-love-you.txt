[Verse 1]
She don't love you, she's just lonely
She wasn't once upon a time
She used to dance when the band played
She used to be the trustin' kind

[Verse 2]
She's no stranger to the leavin'
She's heard all the best goodbyes
Fallin' has a different meanin'
To her, you're just another guy

[Chorus]
She don't love you, she's just lonely
She don't know another way
To break free from what's been broken
Too many cowboys rode away
So forgive her if she's distant
She can't tell her heart to lie, no
You'll never be her one and only
She don't love you, she's just lonely
Yeah

[Verse 3]
You can hold her in the moonlight
You can give her all the stars
You can promise her forever, oh
But you'll never have her heart

[Chorus]
She don't love you, she's just lonely
She don't know another way, no
To break free from what's been broken
Too many cowboys rode away
So forgive her if she's distant
She can't tell her heart to lie, no
You'll never be her one and only
She don't love you, she's just lonely

[Outro]
She don't love you
She don't love you, she's just lonely
She wasn't once upon a time
I remember her in the sunlight
I remember her when she was
Mine
Mine
