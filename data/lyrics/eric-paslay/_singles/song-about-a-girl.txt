[Verse 1]
This ain't about tailgates
Ain't about bonfires
Ain't about souped-up cars, water towers
Or drowning in a bottle of Jack
This ain't about Chevys
Ain't about money
Ain't about blue suede shoes, coo-coo-ca-choos
Got nothing to do with that

[Chorus]
It's a song about a girl
It goes like this
Oh, little heartbreak queen rocking the jeans
Baby, just read my lips
It's a song about a girl
The one you can't forget
Oh, blows your mind every time
You think it's gonna be a hit
It's a song about a girl

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, it's a song about you, oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
This ain't about hometowns
Ain't about back roads
Ain't about shoulda, coulda, wish I woulda
Rearviews, looking back
This ain't about goodbyes
Ain't about comebacks
Oh, got nothing to do with the stars and the moon
Man, you're getting way off track

[Chorus]
It's a song about a girl
It goes like this
Oh, little heartbreak queen rocking the jeans
Baby, just read my lips
It's a song about a girl
The one you can't forget
Oh, blows your mind every time
Think it's gonna be a hit
It's a song about a girl

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

[Bridge]
Mm, mm, mm, baby, you
Yeah, you
Yeah, you know who you are, ha
Baby, you
Yeah, you
Read my lips, hear my heart
Listen to this guitar

[Chorus]
It's a song about a girl
It goes like this
Oh, little heartbreak queen rocking the jeans
Baby, just read my lips
It's a song about a girl
Every time
Oh, don't think too hard, dig too deep
Or read between the lines
It's a song about a girl
It goes like this
Oh, little heartbreak queen rocking the jeans
Baby, just read my lips
It's a song about a girl
The one you can't forget
Oh, blows your mind every time
You think it's gonna be a hit

[Post-Chorus]
It's a song about a girl, girl, oh
It's a song about a girl, girl, oh, yeah
It's a song about a girl, girl, oh
It's a song about a girl

[Outro]
This ain't about tailgates
It ain't about bonfires
Ain't about souped-up cars, water towers
Or drowning in a bottle of Jack
