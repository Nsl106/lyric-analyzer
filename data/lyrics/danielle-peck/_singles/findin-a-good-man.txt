[Verse 1:]
Here's to findin' a good man
Got a bucket of Corona
Enough stories to
Last all night

About the trials
And tribulations
Of findin' Mr. Right
Of findin' a good man

[Chorus:]
Here's to the liars
And the cheaters
And the cold mistreaters
To the mama's boys who can't make a stand

Here's to the superficial players
The I love you too soon sayers
If you hear me girls
Raise your hand
Let's have a toast
Here's to findin' a good man

[Verse 2:]
Blind dates
And horror stories
Pushy guys
And fast movers

Let's dedicate this girl's night out
To big talkers
Bad losers
It's so hard findin' a good man

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Julie
I know you want perfection
Angie
You want a listener
Lisa
Your list is gettin' long
And girls
You know me
I just want a good kisser

[Repeat Chorus:]
