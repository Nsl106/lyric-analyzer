Her turquoise lips kiss me like a lover
Her silver eyes see right through my veins
Her Indian heart asks when I'll return to her
Her Spanish soul begs me to remain
And no one that I've ever known can move me like she does
No, it's not a woman that I love

Santa Fe Santa Fe
I have been here in your arms and now I want to stay
Santa Fe Santa Fe
I won't sleep 'till I'm back in Santa Fe

Her sunrise could bring light into a blind man
Her sunset could put tears there in his eyes
Her colors are laying there in brush strokes
Underneath those peote skies

The lay of the land stirs all of my emotions
She heals me with a laid back energy
She holds onto my broken lifeless spirit
And molds me just like pottery
And nowhere that I've ever been can make me feel this way
That's why I'm going there to stay

Santa Fe Santa Fe
I have been there in your arms, now I want to stay
Santa Fe Santa Fe
I won't sleep 'till I'm back Santa Fe
Santa Fe
No, I won't sleep 'till I'm back in Santa Fe
