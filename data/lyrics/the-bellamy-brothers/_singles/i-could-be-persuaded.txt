I'm not the kind
Who falls in love so easily
More than once or twice
Love has made a fool of me

But I could be persuaded
I could be persuaded

I did not come here
Looking for a rendezvous
Then you said hello to me
And all at once I knew

That I could be persuaded
I could be persuaded
There's no guarantees but when you look at me
I could be persuaded

I could be persuaded
To fall in love tonight
I could be persuaded
To love you for the rest of my life

I never thought I'd find the one
Who'd change my point of view
But I could be persuaded
To fall in love with you

Stand here together
'Neath the summer moon
There ain't no band in sight
But darling, I can hear a tune played

That I could be persuaded
I could be persuaded
I can hear the melody every time you look at me
I could be persuaded

I could be persuaded
To fall in love tonight
I could be persuaded
To love you for the rest of my life

I never thought I'd find the one
Who'd change my point of view
But I could be persuaded
To fall in love with you

I could be persuaded
I could be persuaded
I could be persuaded
I could be persuaded, I could be persuaded
