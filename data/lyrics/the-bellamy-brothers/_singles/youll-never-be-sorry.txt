You'll never be sorry if you let me love you
You'll never be lonely if you let me care
If you'd let me hold you, you'll know what I told you is true
You'll never be sorry if you let me love you

The first time I saw you
I could not forget you
I felt I had known you
All of my life
I have been faithful to you since the moment our eyes said hello
You may think I'm crazy
There's only one way you will know

You'll never be sorry if you let me love you
You'll never be lonely if you let me care
If you'd let me hold you, you'll know what I told you is true
You'll never be sorry if you let me love you

Once in forever fate brings us together like this
Someday when we're older we'll laugh and remember
Those moments before we first kissed

You'll never be sorry if you let me love you
You'll never be lonely if you let me care
If you let me hold you, you'll know what I told you is true
You'll never be sorry if you let me love you
You'll never be sorry if you let me love you
