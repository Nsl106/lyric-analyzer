I watched you walk into the room
I want to say this just right
If you ain't waitin' for somebody special
Would you be with me tonight?

I'm a doctor, I'm a lawyer, I'm a movie star
I'm an astronaut and I own this bar

And I'd lie to you for your love
I'd lie to you for your love
I'd lie to you for your love, that's the truth

I can tell you what you wanna hear
Awesome secrets 'bout myself
I can tell you you're the only one, baby
There'll never be nobody else

Yeah, I'm runnin' for president, I got money to burn
My heart don't ache and my body don't yearn

And I'd lie to you for your love
I'd lie to you for your love
I'd lie to you for your love, that's the truth

Maybe it would be easier just to come out and say it
I ain't never seen a woman quite like you

My family comes from royalty on my daddy's side
And I can read your palms and cards and tell you
Our love just can't be denied

I'm a doctor, I'm a lawyer, I'm a movie star
I'm an astronaut and I own this bar

And I'd lie to you for your love
I'd lie to you for your love
I'd lie to you for your love, that's the truth
That's the truth
