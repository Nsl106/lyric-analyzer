A young girls dreams, they come of age
But she has never turned the page
Shes put it off for so long
She never thought shed feel so strong now
Shes ready to leave her troubles behind

A man like me has seen the score
I watch the waves crash on the shore
A midnight breeze is blowing
We leave the movie knowing
Were both needing so much more

I'll give you all my love tonight
Baby the time has come
This can't be wrong, it feels so right
Any time you question what you feel
You never see whats real
Baby take a good look at me

Its hard erasing all that doubt
But we know one thing baby we just can't live without
We put it off for so long
Now were feeling so strong
And following our hearts will make it right

I'll give you all my love tonight
Baby the time has come
This can't be wrong, it feels so right
Any time you question what you feel
You never see whats real
Baby take a good look at me

I'll give you all my love tonight
Baby the time has come
This can't be wrong, it feels so right
Any time you question what you feel
You never see whats real
Baby take a good look at me
I'll give you all my love tonight
I'll give you all my love tonight
