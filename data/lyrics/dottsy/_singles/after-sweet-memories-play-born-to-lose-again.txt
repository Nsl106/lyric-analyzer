After "Sweet Memories"
Play "Born to Lose" again
Pardon me
I'm just another lonely fool

And I know the band is tired
It's half past two
But would you play one last request for an old friend
After "Sweet Memories"
Play 'Born to Lose' again

After "Sweet Memories"
Play "Born to Lose" again
I'm here most every night
Til the music ends

I know you know my story
I hear it now and then
So after "Sweet Memories"
Play "Born to Lose" again

I know the waitress here
She seats me near the band
She brings me scotch and soda
And her eyes understand

Oh, you hard day's night is ending
But mine will soon begin
So after "Sweet Memories"
Play "Born to Lose" again

After "Sweet Memories"
Play "Born to Lose" again
I'm here most every night
Til the music ends

I know you know my story
I hear it now and then
So after "Sweet Memories"
Play "Born to Lose" again
Yes, after "Sweet Memories"
Play "Born to Lose" again
