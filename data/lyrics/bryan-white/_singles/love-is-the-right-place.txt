Love breathes when you're out of breath
Love sits by the bedside
When you're near to death
And love still feels it
When the feeling's gone
Love lives, on and on

Chorus:
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Love is the right place
Took me a while, took me a while
To get it straight
Now I want to stay
Every day of my life I realize
That I'm in the right place
Love is the right place

Love it moves in mysterious ways
Like mist on the river
At the break of day
So pull open your shutters
Sing a morning song
Love moves on and on

(repeat chorus)
Where you are, near or far
Sun and moon, moon and stars
I know, I know

(repeat chorus)
