Straight out of some story
You walked in, in all your glory
I thought you were perfect for me
I was out of my mind
Looked like I was winning
It was the best love I'd ever been in
Just when we were beginning
The end--you left me behind

And I was looking forward to a happy ending
So much for pretending

I should have known better
Than to think of happy ever
After--you and me together
I was out of my league
I kept my heart hidden
And now I'm wishing that I didn't
Oh who am I kidding
You weren't even intrigued

And I was looking forward to a happy ending
So much for pretending

It could have been beautiful
If I'd only met you
If I'd only let you know
What you meant to me
And if I could I would
Give you a demonstration
Of how my imagination
Thought it ought to be
So much for pretending

Ooh yeah, pretending...pretending
So much for pretending
