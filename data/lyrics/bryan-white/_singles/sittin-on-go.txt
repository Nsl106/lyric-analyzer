I'm waiting on the green light to make you mine
But your heart's just taking it's own sweet time
You want to be sure if you'll sink or swim
Well, grab a hold of me and just jump on in
You're playing it safe
But baby I'll wait

Chorus:
Ooh, whenever you're ready
I could be yours in a second or so
Ooh, baby come and get me
My heart's sitting on go
Ooh, it's off to the races
All you've gotta do is let me know
Ooh, I'm ready and waiting
My heart's sitting on go

You oughta give in now instead of resisting
'Cause I'm not above a little arm twisting
I'm betting it's only a matter of time
Before you and me are standing at the finish line
You're having your doubts
But you'll come around

(repeat chorus)
You're playin' it safe
But baby I'll wait

(repeat chorus)
