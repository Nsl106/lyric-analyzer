[Intro]
I dedicate this song to the working man
For every man that puts in
Eight or ten hard hours a day of work and toil and sweat
Always got somebody looking down his neck
Trying to get more out of him
Than he really ought to have to put in

[Verse 1]
After twenty-nine long years of working in this shop
With Oney standing over me
Today when that old whistle blows
I'll check in all my gear and I'll retire
The superintendent just dropped by
And said they'd planned my little get together
Then he said I'd never a made it
If old Oney hadn't held me to the fire

[Verse 2]
I've seen him in my dreams at night
And woke up in the morning feeling tired
And old Oney don't remember
When I came here, how he tried to get me fired
With his folded hands behind him
Every morning Oney waited at the gate
Where he'd rant and rave like I committed murder
Clocking in five minutes late

[Verse 3]
But today they'll gather 'round me
Like I've seen them do when any man retires
Then old Oney's going to tell me
From now on I'm free to do what I desire
He'll present me with that little old gold watch
They give a man at times like this
But there's one thing he's not counting on
Today's the day I give old Oney his

[Verse 4]
I've been working, building muscles
Oney's just been standing around a getting soft
And today about four-thirty
I'll make up for every good night's sleep I've lost
When I'm gone I'll be remembered
As the working man who put his point across
With a right hand full of knuckles
Because today I show old Oney who's the boss

[Outro]
Hmmmm! What time is it? Four thirty!
Hey, Oney!
Oney! Ha ha ha ha!
