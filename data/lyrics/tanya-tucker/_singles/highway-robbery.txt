Okay officer, I admit it, I was speedin'
But before you write me up, let me tell you the reason

I wasn't tryin' to outrun you
I was chasin' a guy who, out of the blue
He committed a crime back about a mile or two, oh yeah
I was cruisin' along when he pulled up out of nowhere
He was hotter than the truck he drove
And just one lane over, he aimed those angel eyes at me
He smiled like we were meant to be
For he stole my heart from a movin' car

It was highway robbery
He grabbed my heart and took off on the run
It was highway robbery
He oughta do time in my arms for what he's done

So hey officer, how 'bout you understandin'
Won't you turn your blue light on and help me catch that bandit
He's got somethin' that belongs to T
I can't let him get away scot-free
For it's only right that he's mine tonight

It was highway robbery
He grabbed my heart and took off on the run
It was highway robbery
He oughta do time in my arms for what he's done

It was highway robbery
Well, he grabbed my heart and took off on the run
It was highway robbery
He oughta do time in my arms for what he's done
He oughta do time in my arms for what he's done, oh yeah

Hey officer, let's talk about this now
By the time you let me go, that boy'll be all the way in Texas
Sure is good lookin'
By the way, what color are your eyes?
