[Chorus]
When I die I may not go to heaven
Well, I don't know if they let cowboys in
If they don't just let me go to Texas, boys
Texas is as close as I've been

[Verse 1]
New York couldn't hold my attention
Detroit City could not sing my song
If tomorrow finds me busted flat in Dallas
Well, I won't care 'cause at least I'll know I'm home

[Chorus]
When I die I may not go to heaven
Well, I don't know if they let cowboys in
If they don't just let me go to Texas, boys
Texas is as close as I've been

[Verse 2]
I'd ride through all of Hell
And half of Texas just to hear Merle Haggard sing a country song
Beer just ain't as cold in old Milwaukee
My body's here but my soul's in San Antone

[Chorus]
When I die I may not go to heaven
Well, I don't know if they let cowboys in
If they don't just let me go to Texas, boys
Texas is as close as I've been
When I die I may not go to heaven
Well, I don't know if they let cowboys in
If they don't just let me go to Texas, boys
Texas is as close as I've been
When I die I may not go to heaven
Well, I don't know if they let cowboys in
If they don't just let me go to Texas, boys
Texas is as close as I've been
When I die I may not go to heaven
Well, I don't know if they let cowboys in
If they don't just let me go to Texas, boys
Texas is as close as I've been
