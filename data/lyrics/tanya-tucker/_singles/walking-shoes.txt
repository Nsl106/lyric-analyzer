[Verse 1]
I'm gonna put on my walking shoes tonight
Well I'm a-leaving here 'cause you don't treat me right
All you do is make me cry
So now I'm a-gonna say goodbye
I'm gonna put on my walking shoes tonight

[Verse 2]
Yeah I'll be wearing my old travelling hat
Now baby what do you think of that
'Cause all you do is treat me wrong
So honey I'll be good as gone
I'll be wearing my old travelling hat

[Chorus]
I'm the best thing baby that you ever had
And when you find that out you're gonna feel so bad
You'll beg me please, come back home to you
But it's too late, I'm putting on my walking shoes

[Instrumental Break]

Walk on

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I'll be wearing my it's-all-over-coat
And I ain't even leaving you a note
All you do is cause me pain
And I ain't coming back again
I'll be wearing my it's-all-over-coat

[Verse 4]
I'm gonna put on my walking shoes tonight
Well I'm a-leaving here 'cause you don't treat me right
All you do is make me cry
So now I'm a-gonna say goodbye
I'm gonna put on my walking shoes tonight

I'm gonna put on my walking shoes tonight
Yeah I'm gonna put on my walking shoes tonight
