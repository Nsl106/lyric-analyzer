Somebody oughta tell that girl
She's livin' in a dreamers' world
That boy is gone, as gone can be

But it won't be me
No, it won't be me

Somebody oughta set her straight
She oughta give up the wait
He'll never give up being free

But it won't be me
No, it won't be me

To see her fall apart
Would be more than I could bear
I'm just too close
To that girl in the mirror there

Somebody oughta let her know
She's gotta let him know
It's time to face reality

But it won't be me
No, it won't be me

To see her fall apart
Would be more than I could bear
I'm just too close
To that girl in the mirror there

Somebody oughta let her know
She's gotta let him know
It's time to face reality

But it won't be me
No, it won't be me

Well, it won't [Incomprehensible]
No, it won't be me
