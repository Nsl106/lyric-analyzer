I know you like the night-life, the parties and the fun
You like to hang around until the last song has been sung
So I have made arrangements and I wanted you to know
When all the laughter's ended, there's still somewhere you can go

My arms stay open all night
From sundown 'til the morning light
Hopin' you can find where you belong
I leave the lights on
My heart is never closed
You're the only love it knows
The one dream I have is to hold you tight:
My arms stay open all night

Please don't think I'm crazy, I haven't lost my mind
But when it comes to lovin' you, I can always find the time
So if it's after midnight, or just before the break of day
Anytime you need me, it'll never be too late

'Cos my arms stay open all night
From sundown 'til the morning light
Hopin' you can find where you belong
I leave the lights on
My heart is never closed
You're the only love it knows
The one dream I have is to hold you tight:
My arms stay open all night

When all your so-called friends go home
You don't ever have to be alone

'Cos my arms stay open all night
From sundown 'til the morning light
Hopin' you can find where you belong
I leave the lights on
My heart is never closed
You're the only love it knows
The one dream I have is to hold you tight:
My arms stay open all night

My arms stay open all night
