Don't it make life just a little more special
Knowing you've got someone who cares
You won't ever have to be lonely
Always have somebody there

Don't it make everything a little bit easier
Knowing you have someone like me
A hand to take you to the light
When it gets a little bit too dark to see

That's when I like to stop and remind you
You've got me to hold on to, baby
Oh, you've got me to hold on to

Yes, and don't it make every chance
Worth taking even when you try and fail
Don't it make all the pain worth aching
Look around and find somebody there

Oh, don't it make everything a little bit easier
Knowing you have someone like me
A hand to take you to the light
When it gets a little bit too dark to see

That's when I like to stop and remind you
You've got me to hold on to, baby
Oh, you've got me to hold on to

I've got you
I've got you

High and low
Happy or sad
You know I'm gonna be right there

Sharing your smiles
Drying your eyes anytime and anywhere
Cause you've got me to hold on to
Oh, you've got me to hold on to, baby
Cause you've got me to hold on to, honey
