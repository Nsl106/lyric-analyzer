[Verse 1]
In a cozy little restaurant for lovers
It seems so out of place for you and me
We used to play around under the covers
But now it's just a place to watch TV

[Chorus]
So love me like you used to when our love was brand new
And darlin' when we're through you can love me again
And hold me like you want to instead of like you have to
Love me like you used to love me when you used to love me

[Verse 2]
Baby, we could use a long vacation
But the trouble here is bound to tag along
We used to be each other's inspiration
When it only took my touch to turn you on

[Chorus]
So love me like you used to when our love was brand new
And darlin' when we're through you can love me again
And hold me like you want to instead of like you have to
Love me like you used to love me when you used to love me

[Bridge]
Well we used to sit and talk about forever
But now we hardly ever talk at all
We walked a lot of tight ropes together
We always caught each other when we'd fall

[Chorus]
So love me like you used to when our love was brand new
And darlin' when we're through you can love me again
And hold me like you want to instead of like you have to
Love me like you used to love me when you used to love me

[Outro]
Darling, love me like you used to when you used to love me
