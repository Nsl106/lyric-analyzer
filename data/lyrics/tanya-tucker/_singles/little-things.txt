Love can't be measured with diamonds and gold
Before you spend your money, I oughta let you know
If you wanna get to me, try the little things. Don't need that mansion on top of the hill:
Too many rooms with nothing to fill
You can furnish me, with the little things.Rub my back, make me laugh;
Hold me while I dream
All it takes, to make my day
Is to tell me you love me:
Little things.It doesn't matter what mood I'm in
I always melt when you begin
Whispering the little things.Rub my back, make me laugh;
Hold me while I dream
All it takes, to make my day
Is to tell me you love me.Rainy walks, midnight talks;
Dance me on your feet
Hold me close, don't let go
All I'll ever need.Is a single rose; a kiss hello;
That smile upon your face
The tender way, you say my name
Takes my breath away:
Little things, whoa, yeah
Ah now, Love can't be measured with diamonds and gold
All I'll ever need is little things
Little things
