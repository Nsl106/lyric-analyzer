[Verse 1]
Billy was a small-town loner
Never did dream of ever leavin' southern Arizona
Or ever hearin' weddin' bells ring
He never had a lot of luck with the ladies
But sure had a lot of good workin' skills
Never cared about climbin' any ladder
He knew the way in a small café
Found the will

[Verse 2]
He met Miss Bonnie and a little bit of her was a little too much
A few movies and a few months later, the feelin' got strong enough
They didn't own a car, so it must have been love
That drove 'em uptown for a diamond
That's when he started goin'

[Chorus]
Over the line, workin' overtime
To give her things just to hear her say she don't deserve 'em
But he loves her and he just kept goin' overboard
Over the limit to afford to give her things he knew she wanted
'Cause without her, where would he be?
See it's not for him, she is his only need

[Verse 3]
Ring on her finger and one on the ladder
A new promotion every now and then
Bonnie worked until she couldn't tie her apron
Then stayed at home and had the first of two children
And my, how the time did fly
The babies grew up and moved away
Left 'em sittin' on the front porch rockin'
And Billy watchin' Bonnie's hair turn gray

[Verse 4]
And every once in a while, you could see him get up and he'd head downtown
'Cause he'd heard about somethin' she wanted and it just had to be found
Didn't matter how simple or how much, it was love
And boy, ain't that love just somethin'
When it's strong enough to keep a man goin'?

[Chorus]
Over the line, workin' overtime
To give her things just to hear her say she don't deserve 'em
But he loves her and he just kept goin' overboard
Over the limit to afford to give her things he knew she wanted
'Cause without her, where would he be?
See it's not for him, she is his only need

[Outro]
Over the line, workin' overtime
She is his only need
His only need
Overboard, over the limit
Just for her
She is his only need his only need
