[Verse 1]
What good's a dollar without your baby sister?
Two scoops of ice cream on a summer afternoon
We ran wild and all we ever wanted
Was to rule the world between our house and school

[Chorus]
We move on
Put those dreams away
Thinking that we'll find them
Come some rainy day

[Verse 2]
First time I saw you, I knew I would love you
Halfway through sophomore year, I finally asked your name
When I kissed you, I lost my heart completely
All we wanted was just to stay that way

[Chorus]
We move on
Put those dreams away
Hoping that we'll find them
Come some rainy day

[Post-Chorus]
How could I know
That everything would change?
Except the way I miss you
Come some rainy day

[Bridge]
I'll sit and laugh with friends at what we've all been through
But I still catch my breath when someone mentions you

[Chorus]
We move on
Put those dreams away
Baby, I still miss you
Come some rainy day
