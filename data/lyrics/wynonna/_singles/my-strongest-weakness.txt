[Verse 1]
Oh, keeper of the gates of wisdom
Please let me in
'Cause I just can't go through another heartache again
Pretty lies and alibis
How could I be so blind?
Now all alone, I'm scared to stand
Slowly going out of my mind

[Chorus]
He was my strongest weakness
I surrendered heart and soul
It's gonna be a long, long time
'Til I regain control
I'm still a prisoner
Held captive by his memory
He was my strongest weakness
And I'm afraid he'll always be

[Verse 2]
I gave my faithful heart to someone
I couldn't understand
How he held my little world
In the palm of his hand
Now he's gone and life goes on
So if this pain will ever end
Will I be afraid to risk it all?
Ever fall in love again?

[Chorus]
He was my strongest weakness
I surrendered heart and soul
It's gonna be a long, long time
'Til I regain control
I'm still a prisoner
Held captive by his memory
He was my strongest weakness
And I'm afraid he'll always be
He was my strongest weakness
And I'm afraid he'll always be
