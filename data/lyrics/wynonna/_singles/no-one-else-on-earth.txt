[Verse 1]
Well, I've been a rock and I've got my fences
I never let them down
When it comes to love, I keep my senses
I don't get kicked around

[Pre-Chorus]
I shivered once, you broke into my soul
The damage is done now, I'm out of control
How did you get to me?

[Chorus]
No one else on Earth could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on Earth was ever worth it
No one could love me like
No one could love me like you

[Verse 2]
You can make me want you anytime you want to
You're burnin' me alive
I can't deny you even when I catch you
Weavin' a weak alibi

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when the night falls, you make me forget
Your love is killin' me and it ain't over yet
How did you get to me?

[Chorus]
No one else on Earth could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on Earth was ever worth it
No one could love me like
No one could love me like you

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
I shivered once, you broke into my soul
The damage is done now, I'm out of control
How did you get to me?

[Chorus]
No one else on Earth could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on Earth was ever worth it
No one could love me like
No one could love me like
No one else on Earth could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on Earth was ever worth it
No one could love me like
No one could love me like you

[Outro]
No one else on Earth was ever worth it
No one could love me like
No one like you
No one like you
