[Verse 1]
I have sailed a boat or two, out on the wild blue
Yonder to dreams rarely come true
As far as I can see from the island of green
I can put my trust in just one thing

[Chorus]
Only love sails straight from the harbor
And only love will lead us to the other shore
And out of all the flags I've flown
One flies high and stands alone
Only love

[Verse 2]
Peaceful waters, raging sea, it's all the same to me
I can close my eyes and still be free
When the waves come crashin' down and thunder rolls around
I can feel my feet on solid ground

[Chorus]
Only love sails straight from the harbor
And only love will lead us to the other shore
And out of all the flags I've flown
One flies high and stands alone
Only love

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah
Ah

[Chorus]
And only love sails straight from the harbor
And only love will lead us to the other shore
And out of all the flags I've flown
One flies high and stands alone
Only love

[Outro]
Only, only love
Only, only love
Only, only love
Only love
Only, only love
