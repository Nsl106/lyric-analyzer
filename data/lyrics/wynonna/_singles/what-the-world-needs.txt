[Verse 1]
I look around at all the faces and I see
All the lonely people looking back at me
Rich, poor, don't matter, we're all the same
Everybody's hungry in a different way
We're clawin' and climbin' and kickin' and screamin' and fightin', but really

[Chorus]
What the world needs now is love
Love and only love
A little help from up above
Faith to make a better day
Let's come together, lay our differences down
Spread it all around
That's what the world needs now

[Post-Chorus]
La, la, la, la, la

[Verse 2]
Sometimes all it takes is just a smile
To change somebody's weather
Chase the clouds out of their sky
Or sometimes you gotta give and not receive
Sometimes you gotta live what you believe
Open your arms 'cause that's where it starts
Right here with you and with me

[Chorus]
What the world needs now is love
Love and only love
A little help from up above
Faith to make a better day
Let's come together, lay our differences down
Spread it all around
'Cause that's what the world needs now

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Nobody likes the cold
We all need someone to hold
No one wants to be alone

[Chorus]
What the world needs now is love
Love and only love
A little help from up above
Faith to make a better day
Let's come together, lay our differences down
Spread it all around
(That's what the world)
(What the world needs now is love) What the world needs now is love
(Love and only love) Love and only love
A little help from up above
Faith to make a better day
Let's come together, lay our differences down
(Spread it all around) Spread it all around
(That's what the world)
(What the world needs now is love) What the world needs now
(Love and only love) Love and only love
A little help from up above
Faith to make a better day
Let's come together, lay our prejudices down
Spread it all around
