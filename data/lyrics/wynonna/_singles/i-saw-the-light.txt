[Verse 1]
I laid a red rose on your front porch
And wrote "I love you" on a note
I rang the doorbell and turned to go
Baby, when the curtains moved, I couldn't believe the view

[Chorus]
I saw the light in your window tonight
I saw two shadows holdin' each other tight
I know the truth when I look in your eyes
I saw the light in your window tonight

[Verse 2]
So take your cheatin' hands off my red dress
'Cause I ain't wearin' this thing for you
I see you clearly now and your lies too

[Refrain]
They say that love is blind, well, baby, not this time

[Chorus]
I saw the light in your window tonight
And I saw two shadows holdin' each other tight
I know the truth when I look in your eyes
I saw the light in your window tonight

[Bridge]
Why, baby, why? (Why, baby, why?)
Should I listen to you?
I cry, baby, cry (Cry, baby, cry)
Now I'm walkin' out the door (Oh-oh)

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
They say that love is blind, well, baby, not this time
(I saw the light, I saw the light, I saw the light)

[Chorus]
I saw the light in your window tonight
And I saw two shadows holdin' each other tight
I know the truth when I look in your eyes
I saw the light in your window tonight
I know the truth when I look in your eyes
I saw the light in your window tonight
