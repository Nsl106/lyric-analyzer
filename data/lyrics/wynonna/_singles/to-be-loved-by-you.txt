[Verse 1]
Love, that's worth fighting for
That's what this is
And how, how could I want more
Than the warmth of your kiss?

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter how many miles and dreams
Come between us now
In each step I take, with each prayer I make
This love will live somehow

[Chorus]
Let the mountains rise, I will climb them all
When my body's weak, I will not fall
Baby, come what may, and I'll find a way to get through
There's nothing that I won't do to be loved by you

[Verse 2]
There will be lonely nights
When you'll whisper my name
Know on those lonely nights
I'll be doing the same

[Pre-Chorus]
Should every star in the sky go out
Just keep your faith alive
We were meant to be, this is destiny
It cannot be denied

[Chorus]
Let the mountains rise, I will climb them all
When my body's weak, I will not fall
Baby, come what may, I'll find a way to get through
There's nothing that I won't do to be loved by you

[Bridge]
And even when we're worlds apart
Just keep this promise in your heart

[Chorus]
Let the mountains rise, I will climb them all
When my body's weak, I will not fall
Baby, come what may, I'll find a way to get through
There's nothing that I won't do (Nothing that I won't do)
There's nothing that I won't do (Nothing that I won't do)
There's nothing that I won't do to be loved by you

[Outro]
To be loved, to be loved by you
Mm
To be loved by you
