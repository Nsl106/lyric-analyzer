[Verse 1]
Everywhere I look, the sun is shining
But it's always rainin' here inside
I can see
You really had a hold on me
It's a mean old love
With a flame that never dies

[Chorus]
Won't you tell me why
I can't say goodbye?

[Verse 2]
Everywhere I go, you're in my shadow
When I turn around, there's no one there
And it's a real bad sign
I'm walkin' on a real thin line
A fool in love with a fool that never cared

[Chorus]
So won't you tell me why
I can't say goodbye?
Won't you tell me why?

[Bridge]
Ask anyone you know
And they'll say, "Love fades away"
But this heart's cryin' just like yesterday

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
And it's a real bad sign
I'm walkin' on a real thin line
A fool in love with a fool that never cared

[Chorus]
So won't you tell me why
I can't say goodbye?
Won't you tell me why
I can't say goodbye?
