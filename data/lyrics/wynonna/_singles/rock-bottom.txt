[Verse 1]
When you hit rock bottom, you've got two ways to go
Straight up and sideways
I have seen my share of hard times and I'm lettin' you know
Straight up is my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Things are tough all over, but I've got good news
When you get down to nothin', you've got nothin' to lose
I was born naked, but I'm glory bound
And a dead-end street is just a place to turn around

[Chorus]
When the sky is the limit up on easy street
Rock bottom ain't no place to be
Rock bottom ain't no place for me, no, no

[Post-Chorus]
No, no

[Verse 2]
When the law of the jungle is the law of the land
Good luck stayin' alive
I keep a clenched fist under this hat in my hand
'Cause only the strong survive

[Pre-Chorus]
Things are tough all over, but I've got good news
When you get down to nothin', you've got nothin' to lose
And when rock bottom is good, solid ground
And a dead-end street is just a place to turn around

[Chorus]
When the sky is the limit up on easy street
Rock bottom ain't no place to be
Rock bottom ain't no place for me, no, no
