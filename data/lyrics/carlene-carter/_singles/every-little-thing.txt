[Verse 1]
I hear songs on the radio, they might be fast or they might be slow
But every song they play's got me thinking 'bout you
I see a fella walking down the street
He looks at me and he smiles real sweet
But he don't matter to me 'cause I'm thinking 'bout you

[Chorus]
Every little dream I dream about you
Every little thought I think about you
Drives me crazy when you go away
I oughta keep you locked up at home
And like a wild horse I wanna break you
I love you so much I hate you
Every little thing reminds me of you
Honey when you leave me here all alone

[Verse 2]
My tongue gets tied when I try to talk
My knees get weak when I start to walk
So I might as well stay home and keep thinking 'bout you
The Young and Restless on my TV set
That's just like us when we first met
And when they start to kissing got me thinking 'bout you

[Chorus]
Every little dream I dream about you
Every little thought I think about you
Drives me crazy when you go away
I oughta keep you locked up at home
And like a wild horse I wanna break you
I love you so much I hate you
Every little thing reminds me of you
Honey when you leave me here all alone

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Every little dream I dream about you
Every little thought I think about you
Drives me crazy when you go away
I oughta keep you locked up at home
And like a wild horse I wanna break you
I love you so much I hate you
Every little thing reminds me of you
Honey when you leave me here all alone

[Tag]
Every little thing reminds me of you
Honey when you leave me here all alone
Every little thing reminds me of you
Honey when you leave me here all alone
All alone
