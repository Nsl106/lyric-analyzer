[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Last-callers, last-chancers
9-to-5ers, truckers, dancers
Couple Chucks, Ern's, and Chandler's
With a whole lotta prayers unanswered
Whiskey by noon and beer before that
Southbound train on a hellbound track
Might just put two middle fingers up and throw one back
For all the people who ain't ever felt at home
Just spinnin' on a rock and gettin' stoned

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Yeah, this one's for the losers
The outcasts and the sinners
The ain't-never-been-no-winners
Let's hear it for the losers
Ain't got nowhere to fit in
There's a place you can always get in (Oh)
You might be lonely, but you're never alone
You're right here where you're supposed to be
Right here with all the losers
The ones like you and the ones like me

[Verse 2: Jelly Roll]
My therapist is a good bartender
Heartbreakers and two-month benders
Bad times that we can't forget and
Good times that we won't remember
Raise 'em up when we hear a sad song
Love the cry of a steel guitar
No way to change the way we are

[Chorus: Jelly Roll]
This one's for the losers
The outcasts and the sinners
The ain't-never-been-no-winners
Let's hear it for the losers
Ain't got nowhere to fit in
There's a place you can always get in (Oh, oh)
You might be lonely, but you're never alone
You're right here where you're supposed to be
Right here with all the losers
The ones like you and the ones like me

[Bridge: Post Malone & Jelly Roll]
If you're livin' like you got nothin' to lose
There's a spot for you beside me on this stool

[Chorus: Post Malone & Jelly Roll, Jelly Roll, Post Malone]
Come kick it with the losers (Oh)
The outcasts and the sinners
The ain't-never-been-no-winners (Never been no winners)
Let's hear it for the losers (Hear it for the losers)
Ain't got nowhere to fit in
There's a place you can always get in (Yeah)
You might be lonely, but you're never alone
You're right here where you're supposed to be
Right here with all the losers
The ones like you and the ones like me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
