[Verse 1: Post Malone]
I got a guy to sight in my rifle
My mama's new boyfriend re-binds bibles
Ricky down the road, he resoles Red Wings
Hell, I got a guy for every damn thing
Oh, that ain't exactly what I'm lookin' for
'Cause I'm lookin' for

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Someone to put her tires back in the drive
And if they don't, then I just might
Lose what's left of my never-lovin' mind
I'm damn near down to my last dime
I'm pretty good at breakin' down a heart
But pickin' up the pieces is the hard part
She's searchin' for someone who's gonna build it back
But I ain't got a guy for that

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
Ain't got a guy for that, ain't got a guy for that
Ain't got a guy for that

[Verse 2: Luke Combs]
Know a VIP up at MIT
And he still won't let mе fly the time machine
Somеone to turn back the hands on my new AP
But, buddy, what I really need

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
Is someone to put her tires back in the drive
And if they don't, then I just might
Lose what's left of my never-lovin' mind
I'm damn near down to my last dime
I'm pretty good at breakin' down a heart
But picking up the pieces is the hard part
She's searchin' for someone who's gonna build it back
But I ain't got a guy for that

[Post-Chorus: Luke Combs & Post Malone, Post Malone & Luke Combs]
Ain't got a guy for that, ain't got a guy for that (Guy for that)
Ain't got a guy, I ain't got a guy for that
Ain't got a guy for that, ain't got a guy for that
Ain't got a guy, I ain't got a guy for that
