[Verse 1]
A friend of mine bought himself a shovel
Said, "I'm gonna tunnel me a mine"
He set out to be a rich man
Happiness is what he thought he'd find
Got in too deep to see the diamonds
Down too dark to see the gold
Now he won't let go of the shovel
And he can't dig out of the hole

[Chorus]
Deeper and deeper, he's goin' down
Drivin' his future right into the ground
He thinks he's closer the further he goes
But he's still on the bottom
And he can't dig out of the hole

[Verse 2]
I tried to throw the man a lifeline
I tried to send him down a rope
I don't think he hears me callin'
But every day, I pray and I hope
Somehow, he finally gets the message
Every spade of dirt he throws
Only gets him closer to the devil
And he can't dig out of the hole

[Chorus]
Deeper and deeper, he's goin' down
Drivin' his future right into the ground
He thinks he's closer the further he goes
But he's still on the bottom
And he can't dig out of the hole

[Verse 3]
Maybe we could learn a little lesson
Maybe this'll shine a little light
There's no healthy way to mess with
The line between wrong and right
Use the one chance you've been given
'Cause once you're in the ground and cold
It's too late to start livin'
You see, you can't dig out of the hole

[Chorus]
Deeper and deeper, he's goin' down
Drivin' his future right into the ground
He thinks he's closer the further he goes
But he's still on the bottom
And he can't dig out of the hole
It's hell on the bottom
And you can't dig out of the hole
