[Verse 1]
I'm in need of a remedy
To cure me from loving you
It may sound a little extreme
I'll do what I have to do

[Chorus]
Bury your jacket in my backyard
Carry your picture in my shoe
And keep walking 'til the hurting stops
Keep walking 'til my temperature drops
Keep walking 'til the fever is gone
And you're out of my bones

[Verse 2]
I'm in need of a medicine
Something strong that'll work real fast
That I can take to fortify me
To keep my arm from taking you back

[Chorus]
Chase that ghost out from under my bed
Still these voices in my head
They keep talking, weaving their spell
But I'm talking to myself
I keep 'em talking from daylight to dawn
'Til you're out of my bones

[Bridge]
Sweet amnesia, come and set me free
I just need to get you out of me

[Chorus]
Bury your jacket in my backyard
Carry your picture in my shoe
And keep walking 'til the hurting stops
Keep walking 'til my temperature drops
Keep walking 'til the fever is gone
And you're out of my bones
You're out of my bones
