[Verse 1]
Well, there's my easy chair, just sittin' there, I've spent a lot of time
Thinkin' of this perfect love I know is yours and mine
And, oh, how I love that old picture on the wall of you and me and the kids
My most favorite times in life, I've spent right here where we live

[Chorus]
There's no place like home, there's no place like home
It just hit me as I was leavin', there's no place like home

[Verse 2]
From the bedroom, I smell perfume, my favorite kind you wore
And it brings back memories of all those nights behind our bedroom door
And the saddest thing I think I've ever seen was my closet all cleaned out
It's sad to think that one must leave 'cause we can't work things out

[Chorus]
There's no place like home, there's no place like home
It just hit me as I was leavin', there's no place like home

[Verse 3]
So, baby, say that I can stay for just a day or so
Then maybe I can change your mind and I won't have to go
Just look into these baby blues and tell me it's okay
I love that smile, it drives me wild, no, love won't die today

[Outro]
There's no place like home, there's no place like home
