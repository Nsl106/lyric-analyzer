Being without you has turned out to be so inconvenient
And wishing I was with you just seems to use up all my time
You've been gone so long that it's hard to recall just how the dream went
And all but this broken heart and me I guess is doin' fine
Is it still over, are we still through?
Since my phone still ain't ringing, I assume it still ain't you
I'll have to mind to take the time to find somebody new
But I'm not too sure that I'm still over you
That lie that I tried to slip by you was told with good intentions
It was just another way to say I love you and protect you from the truth
And half a pound of cure is surely worth a half an ounce of good prevention
And trying to explain while I'm insane is the hardest thing
I've ever tried to do
Is it still over, are we still through?
Since my phone still ain't ringing, I assume it still ain't you
But I'll have to mind to take the time to find somebody new
But I'm not too sure that I'm still over you
Is it still over, are we still through?
Since my phone still ain't ringing, I assume it still ain't you
But I'll have to mind to take the time to find somebody new
But I'm not too sure that I'm still over you
If I repeat myself it's 'cause I've nothing else to do
And I'm not too sure that I'm still over you
I'm not too sure that I'm still over you
