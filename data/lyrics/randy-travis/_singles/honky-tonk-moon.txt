Dirt road in the twilight, woods so cool and dark
Up ahead pale neon, somewhere a dog barks
Honky tonk moon
Keeps shining on my baby and me
Breaking up the pool balls, chalking up the cues
Juke box pumping softly, lazy summer blues
Honky tonk moon
Keeps shining on my baby and me
Through the blue smoky haze, all through the days
Trouble seemed to melt away
My heart's on a roll, I'm easy in my soul
There's no hurry, no worry, things are goin' my way
My arms around my baby, shufflin' on the floor
Cigarettes and sawdust, squeaky old screen door
Honky tonk moon
Keeps shining on my baby and me
Through the blue smoky haze, all through the days
Trouble seemed to melt away
My heart's on a roll, I'm easy in my soul
There's no hurry, no worry, things are goin' my way
Outside the dark is falling, stars are twinkling bright
That old hoot owl is calling, every thing's all right
Honky tonk moon
Keeps shining on my baby and me
Honky tonk moon
Keeps shining on my baby and me
