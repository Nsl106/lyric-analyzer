I heard a freight train out across the way
I heard a woman sing amazing grace
I heard a night bird call to it's mate
When I heard you whisper my name
I heard freedom break it's chain
I heard a heart beat where once no sound remained
I heard Angels rise and praise
When I heard you whisper my name
I heard music bring a heart of stone to tears
And I heard peace ring like an anthem through the years
And I heard hatred fall from grace
When I heard you whisper my name
Beating softly against the waves
Fell a sound of an early morning rain
And though the lightin' and thunder came
I still heard you whisper my name
I heard music bring a heart of stone to tears
And I heard peace ring like an anthem through the years
And I heard hatred fall from grace
When I heard you whisper my name
I heard Angels rise and praise
When I heard you whisper my name
