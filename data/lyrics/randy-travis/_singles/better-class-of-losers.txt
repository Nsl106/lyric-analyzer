[Verse 1]
I'm gettin' out of this high-rise penthouse suite
Where we pretend life's rosy and sweet
I'm going back to the folks that I used to know
Where everyone is what they seem to be

[Verse 2]
And these high class friends that you like to hang around
When they look my way, they're always looking down
And I'm tired of you spending every dime I make
To finance this way of life I've learned to hate

[Chorus]
I'm going back to a better class of losers
This uptown living's really got me down
I need friends who don't pay their bills on home computers
And they buy their coffee beans already ground
You think it's disgraceful that they drink three dollar wine
But a better class of loser suits me fine

[Verse 3]
You said the grass was greener on the other side
But from where I stand, I can't see grass at all
And the concrete and the steel won't change the way you feel
And it takes more than caviar to have a ball

[Chorus]
I'm going back to a better class of losers
This uptown living's really got me down
I need friends who don't pay their bills on home computers
And they buy their coffee beans already ground
You think it's disgraceful that they drink three dollar wine
But a better class of loser suits me fine

[Outro]
Yes, a better class of loser just suits me fine
