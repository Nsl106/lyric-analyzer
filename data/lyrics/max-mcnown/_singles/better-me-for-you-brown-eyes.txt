[Verse 1]
Love was a game
I played dealer's choice
In the back of a bar all summer
Forgetting names like background noise
In relationships I wanted none of
Went off the rails by fall
Lord knows I needed savin'
Wore off the alcohol
And you were there like an angel waiting

[Chorus]
I didn't know you'd have brown eyes
Like to pray to Jesus
Spending Friday nights at home
Didn't know you'd be the strong kind
Deeper than a coal mine
Lovin' with a heart of gold
And you're everything that I'm not
Everything that I want
Thеre's a God, and baby, you're proof
In those brown еyes
I know that I gotta find a better me for you

[Verse 2]
Made a living dipping toes in the water
Feelin' low with my walls up high
I was staying far away from the deep end
Girl like you made a boy like me try
Went off the rails that fall
Lord knows I needed savin'
Made me forget them all

[Chorus]
And I didn't know you'd have brown eyes
Like to pray to Jesus
Spendin' Friday nights at home
Didn't know you'd be the strong kind
Deeper than a coal mine
Lovin' with a heart of gold
And you're everything that I'm not
Everything that I want
There's a God, and baby, you're proof
In those brown eyes
I know that I gotta find a better me for you

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
A better me for you
(Hoh, ohh-ohh)

[Bridge]
Don't worry 'bout the miles that it takes
We can make every one of them worth all the drivin'
I'll sing your praises every way
Like the hymnals all say
I could love you 'til the end of time, and

[Chorus]
I never knew you'd have brown eyes
Liked to pray to Jesus
Spend your Friday nights at home
Never knew you'd be the strong kind
Deeper than a coal mine
Lovin' with a heart of gold
And you're everything that I'm not
Everything that I want
There's a God, and baby, you're proof
In those brown eyes
I know that I gotta find, better me for you

[Outro]
Yeah, better me for you
Oh-oh-oh
Better me for you
A better me for you
