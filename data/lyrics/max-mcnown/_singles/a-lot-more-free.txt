[Verse 1]
Leaves start falling when the cold wind blows
And soon get covered by the winter snow
Birds start singing when the spring rolls 'round
Flowers blooming through the thawing ground

[Verse 2]
When you love somebody and the love grows cold
The sun starts shining when you let it all go
There's a certain kinda hurting only time can heal
That's a pretty good picture of the way I feel

[Chorus]
I'm a little bit hurt but a lot more free
I ain't saying that you never took a toll on me
For what it's worth, I can finally see
That I'm a little bit hurt but a lot more free
Yeah, I'm a little bit hurt but a lot more free

[Verse 3]
From this mountain, I can see so far
Rivers running like deep, deep scars
Carrying the lifeblood through my veins
Is it crazy that I'm grateful for all the pain?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a little bit hurt but a lot more free
I ain't saying that you never took a toll on me
For what it's worth, I can finally see
That I'm a little bit hurt but a lot more free
Yeah, I'm a little bit hurt but a lot more free
