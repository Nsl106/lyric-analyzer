[Intro]
One, two

[Chorus]
Why's he call you darlin'?
Why's he call you daily?
Why you tryna act like I'm just out here being crazy?
How's he know your mama?
Does he drive your Mercedes?
You can say whatever, baby what you wanna call it
But why's he call you darlin'? Yeah
And if he's just a friend, then tell me why's he always calling?
(Why's he c-)

[Verse 1]
You can't play me like a fiddle girl
See that's where you went wrong
There's been rumors round this town
And now I know what's goin' on
You and him you say you're friends
But we both know damn well
When I ain't around you're going out, but you ain't by yourself

[Refrain]
Ol' boy in a Ridgeline and I drive a Chevy
He ain't got no straight pipes
So, baby, can you tell me

[Chorus]
Why's he call you darlin'?
Why's he call you daily?
Why you tryna act like I'm just out here being crazy?
How's he know your mama?
Does he drive your Mercedes?
You can say whatever, baby what you wanna call it
But why's he call you darlin'?
(And if he's just a friend, then tell me why's he always calling?)
(Why's he call-)

[Verse 3]
You been beating around the bush so much
You're knocking off the leaves
I got my own thoughts of what's going on
When I ain't in Tennessee
What do ya say when the door closed
You can't see if it don't show
You say I'm overthinking just 'cause I wanna know

[Chorus]
Why's he call you darlin'?
Why's he call you daily?
Why you tryna act like I'm just out here being crazy?
How's he know your mama?
Does he drive your Mercedes?
You can say whatever, baby what you wanna call it
But why's he call you darlin'?
(And if he's just a friend, then tell me why's he always calling?)

[Bridge]
(That boy in a Ridgeline and I drive a Chevy)
(He ain't got no straight pipes)
(So, baby, can you tell me)
That boy in a Ridgeline and I drive a Chevy
He ain't got no straight pipes
So, baby, can you tell me

[Chorus]
Why's he call you darlin'?
Why's he call you daily?
Why you tryna act like I'm just out here being crazy?
How's he know your mama?
Does he drive your Mercedes?
You can say whatever, baby what you wanna call it
But why's he call you darlin'? Yeah
(That boy in a Ridgeline and I drive a Chevy)
But why's he call you darlin'? Yeah
(And if he's just a friend, then tell me why's he always calling?)
Why's he call you darlin'?
