[Verse 1]
We have come to the place in our love
Where faith must be stronger than fear
For if true love is our destination
Through every storm it must always be clear
The surest way to get there from here

[Chorus]
Is to walk on faith, trust in love
Just keep on putting one foot down
In front of the other
When the valley's so wide
We stumble in stride
Everything inside wants to give up
Walk on faith, trust in love

[Verse 2]
Farther on beyond the shadows of our doubts
We will live where true love never dies
Though the road we must travel is uncertain
There is a truth in our hearts that never lies
It is by such grace we are bound to arrive

[Chorus]
When we walk on faith, trust in love
Just keep on putting one foot down
In front of the other
When the valley's so wide
Stumble in stride
Everything inside wants to give up
Walk on faith, trust in love

[Tag]
Walk on faith, trust in love
Just keep on putting one foot down
In front of the other
Come on walk on faith

[Fadeout]
When the valley's so wide
Everything inside still wants to give up
Walk on faith
