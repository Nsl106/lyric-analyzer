[Verse 1]
I've got a feelin' deep inside
I've got a feelin' I can't hide, it's true
Just between me and you
Started in my heart and hasn't stopped yet
And I don't know how big it's gonna get, but it's true
Just between me and you

[Chorus]
Just between us, I've seen us
Together in all my dreams
And when we touch, it's too much
It's electricity, yeah
Just between you and me

[Verse 2]
Just you and me and a night like this
You'll take my breath with one sweet kiss, maybe two
Just between me and you
You can call it magic and you can call it love
Call it forever, just say you're thinkin' of it too
Just between me and you

[Chorus]
Just between us, I've seen us
Together in all my dreams
And when we touch, it's too much
It's electricity, yeah
Just between you and me

[Bridge]
This is more than one woman and man
This is greater than the sum of the two

[Verse 3]
I've got a feelin' deep inside
I've got a feelin' I can't hide, it's true
Yeah, just between me and you

[Chorus]
Just between us, I've seen us
Together in all my dreams
And when we touch, it's too much
It's electricity, yeah
Just between you and me

[Outro]
Just between you and me
Just between you and me
You and me
