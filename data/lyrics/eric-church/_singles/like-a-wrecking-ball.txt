[Verse 1]
I, I been gone, been gone too long, singin’ my songs on the road
Another town, one more show, and I'm coming home
Don't give a damn what these keys are for
I'm gonna knock down that front door, and

[Chorus]
I'ma find out what that house is made of
Been too many nights since it's felt us make love
I wanna rock some sheetrock, knock some pictures off the wall
Love you baby, like a wrecking ball

[Verse 2]
You, look at you, send me one more shot, sittin’ on a bathroom sink
Damn you, really turn me on, paintin’ your toenails pink
Easy baby before you say, but if I can make it just one more day, and

[Chorus]
That old house is gonna be shaking
I hope those bricks and boards can take it
But I won't be surprised if the whole damn place just falls
I'm gonna rock you baby, like a wrecking ball

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
That old house is gonna be shaking
Rafter rockin’, foundation quaking
Crash right through the front door, back you up against the wall
Love you baby, take it right there baby
Rock you baby, like a wrecking ball
