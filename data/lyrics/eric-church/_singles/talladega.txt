[Verse 1]
It was the summer before the real world started and
The deal was we would get to go, if we
Cleaned it up and got it runnin'
Daddy's old Winnebago
Wing and a prayer down 65
Five best friends on four bald tires
I can still see Billy smilin'
When we finally made it

[Chorus]
To Talladega, boys raised the
Whiskey in your glass
Here's to turnin' up and slowin' down
And cars that go real fast
We were laughin' and livin', drinkin' and wishin'
And thinkin' as that checkered flag was wavin'
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega

[Verse 2]
Like a stone, time rolls on
You can't hit pause, that's just the deal
Most days in life don't stand out
But life's about those days that will, like
Rockin' Randall gettin' rowdy
Shootin' Roman candles at the
Man in the moon
'Til the Alabama sun was breaking

[Chorus]
Over Talladega, boys raise the
Whiskey in your glass
Here's to turnin' up and slowin' down
And cars that go real fast
We were laughin' and livin', drinkin' and wishin'
And thinkin' as that checkered flag was wavin'
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega

[Post-Chorus]
Talladega

[Bridge]
When the winds grow cold and it blows October
I think about us, shoulder to shoulder
Like those cars, my thoughts roll over
And over and over in my mind

[Chorus]
Tonight I'm in Talladega, boys raise the
Whiskey in your glass
Here's to turnin' up, slowin' down
And cars that go real fast
We were laughin' and livin', drinkin' and wishin'
And thinkin' as that checkered flag was wavin'
I sure would like to stay in
Talladega

[Outro]
Talladega (Talladega)
Talladega
