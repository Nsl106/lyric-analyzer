[Intro]
Bom, bom, bom, bom-oh
Bom, bom, bom, bom-oh

[Verse 1]
Like a honeybee beatin' on my screen door
I got a little buzz, and my head is sore
And from my bed I can feel the sun
Lord, 'round here the morning comes

[Refrain]
Just a-creepin'
Creepin', creepin', creepin'

[Verse 2]
You shot outta here like a bullet from a gun
A flip of a switch
A thief on the run
And since the day you left me baby
I can feel the lonely
I can hear the crazy

[Refrain]
Just a-creepin', creepin'
Just a-creepin', creepin'

[Chorus]
Head for the future
Run from the past
Hide from the mirror
Live in a glass
What dreams forget the whiskey remembers
Kinda like molasses in late December

[Refrain]
Just a-creepin'
Creepin', oh creepin'

[Verse 3]
Your cocaine kiss and caffeine love
Got under my skin and into my blood
That need you back comes over me
Like ivy crawling up a hickory tree

[Refrain]
Just a-creepin', creepin'
Just a-creepin' creepin', creepin'

[Chorus]
Head to the future
Run from the past
Hide from the mirror
Live in a glass
What dreams forget the whiskey remembers
Kinda like molasses in late December

[Refrain]
Just a-creepin', creepin'
Ah, come on

[Bridge]
Break it down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
[Verse 4]
Just last night I saw the light
At the end of that tunnel on the other side
Thought I found my way outta this pain
Only to find your memory train
[Refrain]
Creepin'
Creepin', creepin'
Creepin', creepin'
Creepin', creepin', creepin'
Creepin'
Yeah, creepin'
Creepin'
Yeah creepin' creepin'
Yeah creepin'

[Outro]
Bom, bom, bom, bom-oh
Bom, bom, bom, bom-oh
