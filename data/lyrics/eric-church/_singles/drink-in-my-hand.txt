[Verse 1]
Early Monday mornin' 'til Friday at five
Man, I work, work, work, but I don't climb, climb, climb
Boss man can shove that overtime up his can
All I wanna do is put a drink in my hand

[Chorus]
Fill it up or throw it down
I got a forty-hour week worth of trouble to drown
No need to complicate it, I'm a simple man
All you gotta is put a drink in my hand

[Verse 2]
Yeah, the parking lot is muddy, can't get to the door
I take my jacked-up, drop 'er down in four-by-four
Chill down a long neck, warm up the band
All you gotta is put a drink in my hand

[Chorus]
Fill it up or throw it down
I'm about to tear a new one in this old town
Five, four, three, two, one, I’m a rocket man
All you gotta is put a drink in my hand
That's right

[Verse 3]
You make me wanna go ooh, ooh, ooh, when you dance like that
You got that little tattoo playin' peeky-boo on your back
Yeah, if you want to impress me, baby, here's my plan
All you gotta is put a drink in my hand

[Chorus]
Yeah, fill it up or throw it down
When you drive me home take the long way around
You be my Lois Lane, I'll be your Superman
All you gotta is put a drink in my hand

[Verse 4]
My head Monday mornin' that alarm clock sings
It goes bang, bang, bang, while it ring-ring-rings
Yeah, I'm ready to roll, if you wanna rock again
All you gotta is put a drink in my hand

[Chorus]
Yeah, fill it up or throw it down
I got a little hungover, still hangin' around
Yeah, that hair of a dog is howlin', "Hey there, man"
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand

[Outro]
Yeah, that hair of a dog is howlin', "Hey there, man"
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand
Ooh yeah
