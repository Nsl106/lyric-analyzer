[Verse 1: Dustin Lynch]
She was dressed to kill, I was in my boots
So I had her pegged for the uptown type, yeah
But we talked for a while in a corner booth
Before closin' time, she caught me by surprise

[Chorus: Dustin Lynch]
When she said, "Give me a dirt road, the windows down
Wanna get lost on the edge of town in your Chevrolet"
She said, "Give me a six-pack, some Brooks & Dunn
If you want a country girl, you just found one, let's slip away"
Yeah, "In your Chevrolet"

[Verse 2: Jelly Roll]
I think I fell in love right then and thеre
We werе out the door before the end of the song
I said, "Where to?" She said, "I don't care
Just don't take me home, what you waitin' on?"

[Chorus: Dustin Lynch, Jelly Roll]
"Just give me a dirt road, the windows down
Wanna get lost on the edge of town in your Chevrolet"
She said, "Give me a six-pack, some Brooks & Dunn
If you want a country girl, you just found one, let's slip away"
Yeah, "In your Chevrolet
Let's ride, "In your Chevrolet"

[Bridge: Dustin Lynch, Jelly Roll]
Lord knows I been prayin' for the day
A girl like her would say

[Chorus: Dustin Lynch, Jelly Roll]
"Just give me a dirt road, the windows down
Wanna get lost on the edge of town in your Chevrolet" (In your Chevrolet)
She said, "Give me a six-pack, some Brooks & Dunn
If you want a country girl, you just found one, let's slip away (Let's slip away)
In your Chevrolet" (Ooh)
She said, "Give me a dirt road, the windows down
Wanna get lost on the edge of town in your Chevrolet
Give me a six-pack, some Brooks & Dunn
If you want a country girl, you just found one, let's slip away
In your Chevrolet" (Oh woah)

[Outro: Dustin Lynch, Jelly Roll]
Oh, "In your Chevrolet"
"In your Chevrolet"
