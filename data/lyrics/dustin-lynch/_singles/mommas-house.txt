[Verse 1]
I see your face on every street
Every corner, couple trees
Even got our name on 'em
I feel your love, I hear your laugh
Got them take-me-way-on-back
Hurt-me memories, I don't want 'em
Up and down the boulevard
In and out of every bar

[Chorus]
I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

[Verse 2]
I would start it when where we started at the downtown party
Where you kissed my lips and stole my beer
The city park in the dark where we looked up at the stars
Watched them fireworks pop last year
I'd start it under that Texaco sign where you said goodbye
I'd get some gas and drop a match right there

[Chorus]
I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

[Bridge]
Fire-red flames, sunsets in the sky
Going out, staying in, staying up, long nights
Now I'm waking up alone, wishing I could move on
Blocked your number in my phone, thought it'd help, but it don't

[Chorus]
I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

[Outro]
(Baby, I'd burn this whole town down)
(If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house)
