[Verse 1]
Flame
Girl, you light it up when I hear you say my name
Yeah, you know just how to start it
You shine
And I just can't wait to get you out tonight
Yeah, you know how bad I want it

[Pre-Chorus]
You ride this Chevy like a Cadillac
Blow that one stoplight, no looking back
Wherever we're going, gotta get there fast

[Chorus]
I'm talking red hot, wet kiss falling off your lips
I'm talking red hot, red dress hanging on your hips
I'm talking backseat, heartbeat pounding in my chest
I'm seein' red, I'm seein' red
Can't get you outta my head, girl
Can't get you outta my head
The way you color up my world
I'm seein' red

[Verse 2]
Damn
We can get down someplace just outside of town
I'll bring the bottle if you wanna
That moon
That moon ain't gonna tell on me and you
Just say the word and we're gonna

[Pre-Chorus]
Ride this Chevy like a Cadillac
Blow that one stoplight, no looking back
Wherever we're going, gotta get there fast

[Chorus]
I'm talking red hot, wet kiss falling off your lips
I'm talking red hot, red dress hanging on your hips
I'm talking backseat, heartbeat pounding in my chest
I'm seein' red, I'm seein' red
Can't get you outta my head, girl
Can't get you outta my head
The way you color up my world
I'm seein' red

[Bridge]
No, I can't get you outta my head, girl
Can't get you outta my head

[Chorus]
I'm talking red hot, wet kiss falling off your lips (I'm talking red)
I'm talking red hot, red dress hanging on your hips (Hanging on)
I'm talking backseat (Backseat), heartbeat (Heartbeat) pounding in my chest
I'm seein' red (Oh-oh), I'm seein' red (I'm seein' red)
Can't get you outta my head, girl
Can't get you outta my head
The way you color up my world
I'm seein' red

[Outro]
I'm seein' red
I'm seein' red, red, red, red, red
