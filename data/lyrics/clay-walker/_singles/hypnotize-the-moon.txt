[Verse 1]
She knew she caught my eye
And that was all it took
Ain't it strange how forever changed
With just one look

[Verse 2]
The magic filled the night
She touched my soul like no one else
Yes, the way that woman made me feel
Left me talkin to myself, whoa-oh

[Chorus]
You better run for cover
You better hide your heart
'Cause once you start to love her
You know you'll never stop
She shines like a diamond
When she walks into a room
She could charm the stars (Charm the stars)
Hypnotize the moon

[Verse 3]
Once I held her close
I knew just where I stood
No, you never get a second chance
To ever feel so good

[Verse 4]
Then and there I knew
These words were etched in stone
If you can't feel the power of
The greatest love you've known, whoa-oh

[Chorus]
You better run for cover
You better hide your heart
'Cause once you start to love her
You know you'll never stop
She shines like a diamond
When she walks into a room
She could charm the stars (Charm the stars)
Hypnotize the moon

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You better run for cover
You better hide your heart
'Cause once you start to love her
You know you'll never stop
She shines like a diamond
When she walks into a room
She could charm the stars (Charm the stars)...
She could charm the stars (Charm the stars)
Hypnotize the moon
