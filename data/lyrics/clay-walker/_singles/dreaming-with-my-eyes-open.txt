[Verse 1]
I spent half my life on bended knee, beggin' somebody to change
And the other half prayin' to God that they never would
And all it got me was twice as lost when it all turned out the same
But all that beggin' finally did somebody good

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to dream all night
Of the day that was gone
But come the mornin' light
Forever from now on

[Chorus]
Gonna do my dreaming with my eyes wide open
I'll do my looking back with my eyes closed
We can do some livin' or spend our whole life hopin'
'Cause in the end, we're left with the one we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open

[Verse 2]
Every time the world moved on, I fell a little further behind
From runnin' back or followin' someone home
'Til I learned that one step forward will take you further on
Than a thousand back or a million that ain't your own

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to dream all night
Of the day that was gone
But come the mornin' light
Forever from now on

[Chorus]
Gonna do my dreaming with my eyes wide open
I'll do my looking back with my eyes closed
We can do some livin' or spend our whole life hopin'
But in the end, we're left with the one we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open

[Refrain]
We can do some livin' or spend our whole lives hopin'
'Cause in the end we're left with the ones we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open
