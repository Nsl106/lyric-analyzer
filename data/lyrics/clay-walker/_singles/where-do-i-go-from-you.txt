[Verse 1]
I gas up my truck and I drive into town
But I spend all my time just ridin' around
Tryna shake this negative mood I'm in
I've nowhere to go if I wanna get down
All the usual suspects are hangin' around
But after a round or two, it was just a another day again

[Pre-Chorus]
For a minute or two I'll get you off of my mind
But you keep comin' back to me every time

[Chorus]
Where do I go to get over the fact
That you got on a plane and you ain't coming back?
I said what I said and you did what you had to do
Where does a man have to go to get over the truth?
Where do I go from you?

[Verse 2]
I bury myself in my job all day
Just trying to get lost in the usual ways
Smilin/ and laughin' and jokin' around with the guys
Gotta do something to deaden the pain
So I stare out the window just watchin' the rain
But all I can see in the haze is the gray of your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So what do I do with all the pieces of you in me?
If you're never coming back, set me free

[Chorus]
Where do I go to get over the fact
That you got on a plane and you ain't coming back?
I said what I said and you did what you had to do
Where does a man have to go to get over the truth?
Where do I go from you?
Where do I go from you?

[Chorus]
Where do I go to get over the fact
That you got on a plane and you ain't coming back?
I said what I said and you did what you had to do
Where does a man have to go to get over the truth?
Where do I go from you?
Where do I go from you?
