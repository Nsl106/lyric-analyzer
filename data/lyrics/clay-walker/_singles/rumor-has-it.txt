[Verse 1]
Darlin' you know its true
The rumor you heard about me loving you
Well I never told a soul so
Tell me how the whole world knows

[Chorus]
It must have been the roses and the wine
Or maybe this unexplainable smile
They say where there's smoke there's fire
Well I hope it's true
'Cause rumor has it
You love me too

[Verse 2]
Well I've got a ring and a plan
But I see your on to what to what im gonna ask
Well i never said a thing
Tell me what gave it away

[Chorus]
It must have been the roses and the wine
Or maybe this unexplainable smile
They say where there's smoke there's fire
Well I hope it's true
'Cause rumor has it
You love me too

[Verse 3]
It must have been the roses and the wine
Or maybe this unexplainable smile
They say where there's smoke there's fire
Well I hope its true
'Cause rumor has It

[Chorus]
It must have been the roses and the wine
Or maybe this unexplainable smile
They say where there's smoke there's fire
Well I hope it's true
'Cause rumor has it
You love me too
Yes you do
I heard it too
