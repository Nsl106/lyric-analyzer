[Verse 1]
What's that? I hear angels singin'
Telling me to make my move
Listen to it, their voices ringin' baby
If you feel it, get in the groove

[Chorus]
Love is the rhythm of two hearts beatin'
Poundin' out a message steady and true
Talk to me, baby, tell me what you're feelin'
I know what love is, what's it to you?

[Verse 2]
Time's up, train's a leavin', baby
Are you ready to take that ride?
Get on board, don't keep me waiting, baby
Say you're willing to cross that line

[Chorus]
Love is the rhythm of two hearts beatin'
Poundin' out a message steady and true
Talk to me, baby, tell me what you're feelin'
I know what love is, what's it to you?

[Bridge]
I'm sure your heart is tellin' you true
I gotta know what love is to you

[Chorus]
'Cause to me it's the rhythm of two hearts beatin'
Poundin' out a message steady and true
Talk to me, baby, tell me what your feelin'
I know what love is, what's it to you?

[Chorus]
Love is the rhythm of two hearts beatin'
Poundin' out a message steady and true
Talk to me, baby, tell me what you're feelin'
I know what love is, what's it to you?

[Refrain]
I know what love is, what's it to you?
