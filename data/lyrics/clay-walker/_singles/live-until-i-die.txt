[Verse 1]
Skippin' rocks, skippin' rope
Laughin' at all my best friend's jokes
Things I loved when I was a kid
Muddy roads, muddy feet
I didn't live on no blacktop street
Things have changed a lot, but I never did

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna think about tomorrow
I don't need anything money can buy
I don't have to beg, steal, or borrow
I just wanna live until I die

[Verse 2]
Livin' right, livin' in
This little old town I grew up in
But I still held on to my dreams
Standin' proud, standin' tall
Standin' smack dab in the middle of it all
I don't worry about things that I can't change

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna think about tomorrow
I don't need anything money can buy
I don't have to beg, steal, or borrow
I just wanna live until I die

[Bridge]
And everything around me
Are things I dearly love
And every night I get on my knees
And thank the Lord above

[Chorus]
That I don't have to think about tomorrow
I don't need anything money can buy
I don't have to beg, steal, or borrow
I just wanna live until I die

[Outro]
I don't have to beg, steal, or borrow
I just wanna live until I die
