[Verse 1]
How in this world can we put a man on the moon
And still have a need for a place like St. Jude's?
And why is one man born in a place where all they know is war
And a guy like me has always been free?

[Verse 2]
And how can two people who built a lovin' home
Try for years and never have a child of their own
When somewhere out there, tonight, there's a baby no one's holdin' tight
In need of love? To me that don't add up

[Chorus]
But I wasn't there the day you filled up the oceans
I didn't get to see you hang the stars in the sky
So I don't mean to second guess you or criticize what I don't understand
These are just a few questions I have

[Verse 3]
And why did my cousin have to die in that crash?
A good kid, only seventeen, I still wonder 'bout that
It seems unfair to me some get the chance to chase their dreams
And some don't, but what do I know?

[Chorus]
I wasn't there the day you filled up the oceans
I didn't get to see you hang the stars in the sky
So I don't mean to second guess you or criticize what I don't understand
These are just a few questions I have

[Verse 4]
Why do I feel like you hear these prayers of mine
When so many oughta be ahead of me in line?
When you look down on me, can you see the good through all the bad?
These are just a few questions I have
