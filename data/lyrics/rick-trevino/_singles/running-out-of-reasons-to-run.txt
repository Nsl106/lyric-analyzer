[Verse 1]
There's a long stretch of blacktop
Underneath a cloudless sky
There's my truck, washed and gassed up
Just itchin' for a ride
If this had been six months ago
I know what I'd have done
But girl, I'm running out of reasons to run

[Chorus]
I'm running out of reasons
I've lost that restless feeling
Slowly I'm believing
I'm where I'm supposed to be
When you hold me, I feel no need
To chase that setting sun
I'm runnin' out of reasons to run

[Verse 2]
There you stand, smiling at me
Sunlight shinin' through your hair
There's that door, standing open
With no rush to go nowhere
I'm finding all I've searched for
In this love that we've begun
Girl, I'm running out of reasons to run

[Chorus]
I'm running out of reasons
I've lost that restless feeling
Slowly I'm believing
I'm where I'm supposed to be
When you hold me, I feel no need
To chase that setting sun
I'm runnin' out of reasons to run

[Chorus]
I'm running out of reasons
I've lost that restless feeling
Slowly I'm believing
I'm where I'm supposed to be
When you hold me, I feel no need
To chase that setting sun
I'm runnin' out of reasons to run
