[Verse 1]
If she says I caused her hurt
You can take her at her word
And know she's speakin' from her heart
And when she talks about the pain
If she says that I'm to blame
You can bet I did my part

[Pre-Chorus]
If she says I didn't lift a hand when she walked away
It's true, I didn't make her stay

[Chorus]
But she can't say I didn't cry
She can't say she didn't know
How it tore me up inside
How it hurt to watch her go
There's a million things that she might say
That I cannot deny
But she can't look me in the eye
And say I didn't cry

[Verse 2]
And if you haven't heard by now
How much I let her down
When you do, you can sure believe
That I made some mistakes
But that don't take away
From just how much she meant to me

[Pre-Chorus]
She can say I gave her every reason to leave
But there's one thing she can't say about me

[Chorus]
Well, she can't say I didn't cry
She can't say she didn't know
How it tore me up inside
How it hurt to watch her go
There's a million things that she might say
That I cannot deny
But she can't look me in the eye
And say I didn't cry

[Outro]
There's a million things that she might say
That I cannot deny
But she can't look me in the eye
And say I didn't cry
