[Verse 1]
I've never felt such emptiness
I've had it made I must confess
I've had you, I've never been alone
So keep in mind I'm a little green
Yeah, this is all so new to me
But I'm learning as you go

[Chorus]
So girl take it easy
On this heart of mine
Remember as you leave me
This is my first time
And girl while you're walking out
Please walk out real slow
'Cause I'm learning as you go

[Verse 2]
It's hard to see through all these tears
Just where I should go from here
I've never been down this old lonesome road
So excuse me if my heart should break
I'm bound to make a few mistakes
But I'm learning as you go

[Chorus]
So girl take it easy
On this heart of mine
Remember as you leave me
This is my first time
And girl while you're walking out
Please walk out real slow
'Cause I'm learning as you go

[Outro]
And girl while you're walking out
Please walk out real slow
'Cause I'm learning as you go
Yeah, I'm learning as you go
