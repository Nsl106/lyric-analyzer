[Verse 1]
It wasn't the books that I didn't read
It wasn't the teachers who tried to teach me
It wasn't that varsity baseball coach
Kept on tellin' them locker room jokes

[Chorus]
It was Bobbie Ann Mason, back in high school
She was way too cute, she was way too cool
How was I gonna get an education
Sittin' right in back of Bobbie Ann Mason

[Verse 2]
Well Bobbie knew her hist'ry, Bobbie knew her French
Bobbie knew how to keep the boys in suspense
She'd tease with a touch, she'd tease with a kiss
I was three long years being teased by Pretty Miss...

[Chorus]
...Bobbie Ann Mason back in high school
She was way too cute, she was way too cool
How was I gonna get an education
Sittin' right in back of Bobbie Ann Mason

[Verse 3]
Well Bobbie graduated first in her class
Me, I graduated closer to last
Bobbie went to college, she got a degree
I got a guitar so I could sing about

[Chorus]
Me and Bobbie Ann Mason, back in high school
She was way too cute, she was way too cool
How was I gonna get an education
Sittin' right in back of Bobbie Ann Mason

[Verse 4]
Well the years have taught me the basics of math
Divorce divides and time subtracts
Takes away your hair, takes away your jump shot
But it ain't gonna take all the memories I've got of

[Chorus]
Bobbie Ann Mason back in high school
She was way too cute, she was way too cool
How was I gonna get an education
Sittin' right in back of Bobbie Ann Mason
Back in high school
She was way too cute, she was way too cool
I got most of my education
Sittin' right in back of Bobbie Ann Mason
