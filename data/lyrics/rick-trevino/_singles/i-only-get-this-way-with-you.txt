[Verse 1]
I only feel like I feel with you and nobody else
And I only want to be with you and be myself
But when I look in your eyes
Something happens to me every time
And I can't seem to find what to say or do

[Chorus]
I only get this way with you
I only get this way with you
I only feel this way with you
And when were together
I feel like I never ever felt before
As if I'm walking through that door
To love a love like I never knew
I only get this way with you

[Verse 2]
I want you to know how I feel when I'm holding you in my arms
And I want you to know how I miss you when we're apart
But when I look in your eyes
Something happens to me every time
And I can't seem to find what to say or do

[Chorus]
I only get this way with you
I only get this way with you
I only feel this way with you
And when were together
I feel like I never ever felt before
As if I'm walking through that door
To love a love like I never knew
I only get this way with you

[Bridge]
When I think about all the times I've known
What I thought was love, it was never this strong

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I only feel this way with you
And when were together
I feel like I never ever felt before
As if I'm walking through that door
To love a love like I never knew
I only get this way with you

[Outro]
I only get this way with you
I only feel this way with you
