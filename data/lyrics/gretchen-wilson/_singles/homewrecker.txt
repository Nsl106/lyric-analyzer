[Verse 1:]
Well
You're a real hot cookie with your new hairdo
Your high heel boots and your credit card
Long legs and a mini skirt
Yeah, you know what works and you work it hard

You smile like such a lady
Innocent and sweet
You drive the men folk crazy
But any girl can see you're just a

[Chorus:]
Homewrecker
I know what you're doing
You think you're gonna ruin what I got
But you're not

Yeah, you little go getter
I'll teach you a lesson
If you get to messing with my man
You don't stand a chance
No, you're just a homewrecker

[Verse 2:]
I'm sure you waited for a long, long time
To find a man like mine
But honey
You're too late

So before you go and make your move
Maybe me and you should get a few things straight
There's two ways we can do this
I'll let you decide
You can take it somewhere else
Or we can take it outside, you little

[Repeat Chorus:]
Homewrecker
I know what you're doing
You think you're gonna ruin what I got
But you're not

Yeah, you little go getter
I'll teach you a lesson
If you get to messing with my man
You don't stand a chance
No, you're just a homewrecker

[Bridge:]
Now, honey
I'm a Christian
But if you keep it up
I'm-a gonna go to kicking your pretty little butt
Is that clear enough?
Yeah, you little

[Chorus:]
Homewrecker
I'll teach you a lesson
If you get to messing with my man
You don't stand a chance
No, you're just a homewrecker

Yeah
You're just a homewrecker
A homewrecker
