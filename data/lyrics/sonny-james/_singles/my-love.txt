My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine softer than a sigh
My love is deeper than the deepest ocean wider than the sky
My love is brighter than the brightest star that shines every night above
And there is nothing in this world that could ever change my love

Something happened to my heart the day that I met you
Something that I never felt before
You are always on my mind no matter what I do
And every day it seems I want you more
My love is warmer...

Once I thought that love was meant for anyone else but me
Once I thought you'd never come my way
Now it only goes to show how wrong we all can be
For now I have to tell you every day
My love is warmer...
