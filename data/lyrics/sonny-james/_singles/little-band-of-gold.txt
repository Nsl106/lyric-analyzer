There you were, standing there, smiling as you made your plans
You were going to leave me and go with him
You said you loved him so and your love would always be
But that's the very same thing, you once told me

And you still had my little golden band on your hand
Does my little band of gold mean nothing to you?
To me, it means the world but you tore my world apart
You're leavin' me alone with my broken heart

There you were, standing there, smiling as you made your plans
You were going to leave me and go with him
You said you loved him so, and your love would always be
But that's the very same thing you once told me

And you still had my little golden band on your hand
Does my little band of gold mean nothing to you?
To me, it means the world but you tore my world apart
You're leavin' me alone with my broken heart

So take my little golden band from your hand
My little band of gold means nothing to you
To me, it meant the world but you tore my world apart
You're leavin' me alone with my broken heart
