Mr. Lovemaker, don't let anyone take her
I need that woman's love to set me free
Mr. Lovemaker, don't let anyone take her
Till I can make her love me

Hey, I know you're out there somewhere
And I know you've got the power to make her care
If you've ever thought of helping me help me now
Take her by the hand and guide her to my arms somehow

Mr. Lovemaker, don't let anyone take her
I need that woman's love to set me free
Mr. Lovemaker, don't let anyone take her
Till I can make her love me

Mr. Lovemaker, don't let anyone take her
I need that woman's love to set me free
Mr. Lovemaker, don't let anyone take her
Till I can make her love me...
