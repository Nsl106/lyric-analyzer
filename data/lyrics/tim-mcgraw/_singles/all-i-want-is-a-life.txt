[Verse 1]
I just want to get a little more out of my payday
Finally own a car that doesn't break down on the freeway
A little vacation ain't asking very much
I hate coming home to this old broken-down apartment
I wish I had a dime for every hole that's in the carpet
I don't want it all, but I ain't got enough

[Chorus]
All I want is a life
To drink from a glass from a well that ain't dry
I'm sick of the crumbs, I want a piece of that pie
All I want is a life

[Verse 2]
I don't mind the hours and the pain that comes from working
But it's enough to kill me when I see my baby hurting
Wanna give her that diamond I never got to buy
She keeps telling me that everything is getting better
But one step up the rung and someone knocks me off the ladder
Just want to break even someday before I die

[Chorus]
All I want is a life
To drink from a glass from a well that ain't dry
I'm sick of the crumbs, I want a piece of that pie
All I want is a life

[Chorus]
Oh, all I want is a life
To drink from a glass from a well that ain't dry
I'm sick of the crumbs, I want a piece of that pie
All I want is a life

[Outro]
All I want
Is a life
All I want
Is a life
