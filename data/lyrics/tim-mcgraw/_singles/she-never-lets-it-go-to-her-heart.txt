[Verse 1]
Everywhere I go, they're staring at her
Every man I know, he wants to have her
I guess I ought to be a jealous man
I look the other way, they're hitting on her
Every night and day, they telephone her
They try and get to her but I know they can't

[Chorus]
'Cause she never lets it go to her heart
She never lets it go that far
When they start talking, she starts walking right back to my arms
She can turn every head but she never lets it go to her heart

[Verse 2]
She walks into the room and everybody
Watches every move, hoping she don't love me
I know it by the way they hang around
But they don't realize there's more to her
Than what meets the eye, that's why I am certain
No matter what they do to reach her now

[Chorus]
She never lets it go to her heart
She never lets it go that far
When they start talking, she starts walking right back to my arms
She can turn every head but she never lets it go to her heart

[Chorus]
'Cause she never lets it go to her heart
She never lets it go that far
When they start talking, she starts walking right back to my arms
She can turn every head but she never lets it go to her heart
