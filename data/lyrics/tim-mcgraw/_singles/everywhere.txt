[Verse 1]
We were born in this little town
Growin' up I was countin' down
Every single day
Till we made our getaway

[Verse 2]
But you said you could never see yourself
Tryin' to make a life anywhere else
This would be your home
And I was on my own

[Pre-Chorus]
But ever since you said good-bye
I've been out here on the wind
Baby you would be surprised
All the places you have been

[Chorus]
I've seen you in Albuquerque, waitin' out a blizzard
Arizona, dancin' 'cross the desert
Watchin' the sunset in Monterey
Girl, I swear just the other day you were
Down in Georgia, pickin' them peaches
In Carolina, barefoot on the beaches
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you everywhere

[Verse 3]
Now a days, when I'm passin' through
The conversation always turns to you
And I hear you're doin' fine
Livin' out by the county line

[Verse 4]
Got a man that's home every night
A couple of kids and the kind of life
That you wanna lead
Guess you could say the same for me

[Pre-Chorus]
But you and I made our choices
All those years ago
Still I know I'll hear your voice
And see you down the road

[Chorus 2]
Maybe in Oklahoma drivin' 'cross the prairie
In Dallas, Texas isn't that where we
Always said we would like to try?
Never did so maybe that's why you're on
Every highway, just beyond the high-beams
Right beside me in all of my sweet dreams
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you in

[Chorus 1]
Albuquerque, waitin' out a blizzard
In Arizona, dancin' 'cross the desert
Watchin' the sunset in Monterey
Girl, I swear just the other day you were
Down in Georgia, pickin' them peaches
In Carolina, barefoot on the beaches
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you everywhere
