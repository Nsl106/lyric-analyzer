[Verse 1]
After all this time, I still miss you every day
The same world spins 'round, I guess some things never change
Sometimes I go out but it never feels the same
I still look for you, baby, some things never change

[Verse 2]
When I said I'd love you for eternity
I just never knew how true those words would be
Just an old love song, just a mention of your name
My heart breaks in two again, I guess some things never change

[Verse 3]
Maybe someday, someone else will set me free
Until then I'll live with your love's legacy
And I'll keep holding on, hoping you'll come back someday
You can rest assured, baby, some things never change
Girl, I'm still in love with you, I guess some things never change

[Outro]
I still love you
I guess some things never change
