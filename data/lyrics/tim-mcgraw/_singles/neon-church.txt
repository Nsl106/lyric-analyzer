[Verse 1]
I need Jesus or I need whiskey
Whatever works best to get me through
Gettin' over you
A little Friday night hallelujah
A congregation of backsliders just like me
Yeah, what I need

[Chorus]
Is a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church

[Verse 2]
Baptize me in that barroom smoke
Bartender, preach to me 'til my heart ain't broke no more
Ain't that what this place is for?
I tried bended knee, hands-up prayin'
But damn did that hurt, don't just keep hangin' around
What I need right now

[Chorus]
Is a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church

[Bridge]
Just a-sippin' down that unholy water
Save that hurt-like-hell for tomorrow
I'll stay here all night
In a neon church
With the party crowd
Where the good times roll
And the music's loud
Instead of home starin' holes in the ceiling
I got a feeling

[Chorus]
I need a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church
I need a neon church
