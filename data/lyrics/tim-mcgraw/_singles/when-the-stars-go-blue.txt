[Verse 1]
Dancin' when the stars go blue
Dancin' when the evening fell
Dancin' in your wooden shoes
In a wedding gown

[Verse 2]
Dancin' out on 7th Street
Dancin' through the underground
Dancin' with the marionette
Are you happy now?

[Chorus]
Where do you go when you're lonely?
Where do you go when you're blue?
Where do you go when you're lonely?
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue

[Verse 3]
Laughin' with your pretty mouth
Laughin' with your broken eyes
Laughin' with your lover's tongue
In a lullaby

[Chorus]
Where do you go when you're lonely?
Where do you go when you're blue?
Where do you go when you're lonely?
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue
