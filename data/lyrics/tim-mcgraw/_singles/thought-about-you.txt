[Verse 1]
Saw a young Mama laughin' talkin' on the phone
With a little girl workin' on an ice cream cone
Drippin' on her shoes
And I thought about you

[Verse 2]
Saw a spring break Honda hell-bent for Daytona
The boys in the back hiding their Corona
Like kids do
And I thought about you

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought about me
I thought about God
Everything love is
And everything it's not

[Chorus]
I thought about songs that make us feel better
I thought about faith that ties it all together
I thought about now, then thought about forever
I thought about fire and how we walked through it
The times I got it right, the times I blew it
I thought about real, I thought about good, I thought about true
And I thought about you

[Verse 3]
I saw "hungry" misspelled on a cardboard sign
And a dirty t-shirt that said "Roll Tide"
So I gave him a few
And I thought about you

[Verse 4]
Ran into a buddy, he said "How long's it been?"
I said "A couple years," he said "Boy, it's been ten"
That's what time'll do
And I thought about you

[Chorus]
I thought about songs that make us feel better
I thought about faith that ties it all together
I thought about now, then thought about forever
I thought about fire and how we walked through it
The times I got it right, the times I blew it
I thought about real, I thought about good, I thought about true
And I thought about you
I thought about you

[Post-Chorus]
I thought about me
I thought about God
Everything love is
And everything it's not

[Verse 5]
I saw a red balloon somebody just let fly
I watched it gettin' smaller up in the sky
For a minute or two
And I thought about you
