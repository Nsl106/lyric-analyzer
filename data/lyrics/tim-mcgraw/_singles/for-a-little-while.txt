[Verse 1]
Hot sun, dancin' on the river
We're sittin' on the bank, watch the world go by
Our feet in the water, she pressed her lips to mine
We were so long on love, but short on time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She could be a honeymoon sweet and a little wild
But she was mine, oh, for a little while

[Chorus]
And I laugh every time I start to think about us
We sent that summer out in style
And she's gone but she let me with a smile
'Cause she was mine for a little while

[Verse 2]
We'd take a ride and head on down to Airport Road
Put the seats back and watch the planes leave town
She always said nobody's strong enough to tie her down
Oh, but I wasn't lookin' for that, anyhow

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I knew she'd leave, but I didn't know when
It matters to me now, oh, but it didn't back then

[Chorus]
And I laugh every time I start to think about us
We sent that summer out in style
And she's gone but she let me with a smile
'Cause she was mine for a little while

[Bridge]
I keep seein' pictures now
Of me and her and those summer nights
My mind fills with her
Oh, but it's alright

[Chorus]
'Cause I laugh every time I start to think about us
We sent that summer out in style
And she's gone but she let me with a smile
'Cause she was mine

[Outro]
Yeah she was mine
Oh, for a little while
Yeah
