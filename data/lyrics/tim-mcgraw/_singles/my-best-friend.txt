[Verse 1]
I never had no one that I could count on, I've been let down so many times
And I was tired of hurtin', so tired of searchin' 'til you walked into my life
It was a feeling I'd never known
And for the first time, I didn't feel alone

[Chorus]
You're more than a lover, there could never be another to make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer, I fall in love all over every time I look at you
I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend, oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
You stand by me and you believe in me like nobody ever has
When my world goes crazy, you're right there to save me, you make me see how much I have
And I still tremble when we touch
And, oh, the look in your eyes when we make love

[Chorus]
You're more than a lover, there could never be another to make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer, I fall in love all over every time I look at you
And I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend, ooh-oh-oh
You're my best friend, uh-huh

[Chorus]
You're more than a lover, there could never be another to make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer, I fall in love all over every time I look at you
And I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
Oh, you're my best friend (My best friend)
Oh, yeah
Ooh
You're my best friend (My best friend)
