[Chorus]
She's my kind of rain
Like love in a drunken sky
She's confetti falling down all night

[Verse 1]
She sits quietly there
Black water in a jar
Says, "Baby why are you trembling like you are?"

[Pre-Chorus]
So I wait
And I try
I confess like a child

[Chorus]
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

[Verse 2]
She's the sun set shadows
She's like Rembrandt's light
She's the history that's made at night
She's my lost companion
She's my dreaming tree
Together in this brief eternity
Summer days, winter snow
She's all things to behold

[Chorus]
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

[Pre-Chorus]
So I wait
And I try
I confess all my crimes

[Chorus]
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

[Outro]
She's my kind of rain
Rain (Oh) on me (Rain on me)
She's my kind of rain
She's my kind of rain
(Rain on me) She's my kind of rain
