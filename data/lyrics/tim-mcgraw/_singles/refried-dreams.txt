[Verse 1]
Last Monday mornin', you left with no warnin', I started goin' insane
Well, I headed south out of Del Rio, Texas with a hell of a load on my brain
And I kept on goin' without even knowin' how much your love really means
Now I'm messed up in Mexico, livin' on refried dreams

[Chorus]
I'm down here in Mexico, sick as a dog
My head is poundin' in this border town fog
Down to my last dime and comin' apart at the seams
I'm messed up in Mexico, livin' on refried dreams

[Verse 2]
This picture ain't pretty, I'm ragged and dirty and wonderin' what I'm doin' here
Shootin' tequila, wantin' to kill you and wishin' to God you were near
So full of your memory, but feelin' so empty, I've run out of my self-esteem
Now I'm messed up in Mexico, livin' on refried dreams

[Chorus]
I'm down here in Mexico, sick as a dog
My head is poundin' in this border town fog
Down to my last dime and comin' apart at the seams
I'm messed up in Mexico, livin' on refried dreams
I'm down here in Mexico, sick as a dog
My head is poundin' in this border town fog
Down to my last dime and comin' apart at the seams
I'm messed up in Mexico, livin' on refried dreams
Oh, I'm messed up in Mexico, livin' on refried dreams
