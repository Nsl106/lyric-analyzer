[Verse 1]
Hey, next girl, you don't know me
I'm just the one he says went crazy on him
That's just what he does
But once upon a time I was the next girl
I've been where you're at
You overlook a lot when he looks like that
He'll charm your mama with that smile
Hide the red flags for a little while

[Chorus]
I bet you probably met him at a bar
Let him walk you to your car
I bet he said he never falls this hard
Yeah, I remember that part
He knows how to say all the right things
Knows how to gеt you outta that dress
Knows how to make you think you're thе best thing
But I know what happens next, girl

[Verse 2]
Hey, next girl, you think that you know better
Maybe the last girl was just a little bitter and jaded
Yeah, there ain't no doubt
But if he ever talks about the ex girl
She tried like hell
It was too late to save herself
So now she's just tryna help the next girl

[Chorus]
I bet you probably met him at a bar
Let him walk you to your car
I bet he said he never falls this hard
Yeah, I remember that part
He knows how to say all the right things
Knows how to get you outta that dress
Knows how to make you think you're the best thing
But I know what happens next

[Bridge]
You're gonna think it's all your fault
It's just a switch that he turns off
He'll make you think it's love
But I promise you, it's not
Oh no, it's not, no

[Chorus]
Oh, and I bet you probably met him at a bar
Let him walk you to your car
I bet he said he never falls this hard
Yeah, I remember that part
He knows how to say all the right things
Knows how to get you outta that dress
Knows how to make you think you're the best thing
But I know what happens next, girl
