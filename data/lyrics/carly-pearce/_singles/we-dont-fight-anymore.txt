[Verse 1: Carly Pearce]
I couldn't make you jealous if I tried
You couldn't care less if I stayed out all night
I don't even look into your eyes
'Cause the truth is I don't even care if you're lyin'

[Pre-Chorus: Carly Pearce]
In this bed we
Might as well be
Across the ocean
Tonight

[Chorus: Carly Pearce & Chris Stapleton, Carly Pearce]
We don't yell, 'cause what the hell difference would it make?
We don't cuss and we don't care enough to even hate
We could tear up the house, wе could burn the whole thing down
But, boy, what for? 'Cause wе don't even fight anymore

[Verse 2: Carly Pearce]
The only time we ever touch is in the hall
We talk about the weather if we talk at all
If your phone rings in the middle of the night
I don't even try to look to see who's callin'

[Pre-Chorus: Carly Pearce]
I had a bad day, but
You don't know it 'cause
You don't ask and
I don't show it

[Chorus: Both]
We don't yell, 'cause what the hell difference would it make?
We don't cuss and we don't care enough to even hate
We could tear up the house, we could burn the whole thing down
But, boy, what for? 'Cause we don't even fight anymore

[Bridge: Chris Stapleton, Carly Pearce, Both]
I wish you would say somethin' (Say anything)
You wish I would say somethin' (Say anything)
But we never say nothin'
No, we never say nothin'

[Chorus: Carly Pearce, Both]
We don't yell, 'cause what the hell difference would it make?
We don't cuss and we don't care enough to even hate
We could tear up the house, we could burn the whole thing down
But, boy, what for? 'Cause we don't even fight anymore

[Outro: Carly Pearce, Chris Stapleton]
No, we don't (No, we don't even)
Mm
