Woke up this morning with you by my side
Thought I was dreaming with my eyes wide open
I had to touch you and feel you near
Are you really here?

I plan to be the one who sticks around
Ooh, your love can lift me up above the clouds
I get so high when I'm with you
I may never come down

When forever starts
There's no stoppin', no stoppin'
No stoppin' your heart
Like a river
It just keeps on rolling
'Til it fills you up to overflow
And there's no stoppin', no stoppin'
No stoppin' your heart

When you touch me
It's like paradise
Tropical islands and soft moonlight all night
It's almost like falling in love for the very first time
When forever starts
There's no stoppin', no stoppin'
No stoppin' your heart

Like a river
It just keeps on rollin'
'Til it fills you up to overflow
And there's no stoppin', no stoppin'
No stoppin' your heart
When you really found it
There's no doubt about it
There's no stoppin', no stoppin'
No stoppin' your heart

Like a river
It just keeps on rollin'
'Til it fills you up to overflow
And there's no stoppin', no stoppin'
No stoppin' your heart

Whoa, like a river it just keeps on rollin'
'Til it fills you up to overflow
And there's no stoppin', no stoppin'
No stoppin' your heart
