[Verse 1]
I wanna buy you a drink, maybe one for this whole town
I may not have that much, but I don’t mind spreading it around
Everybody chasing something, I don’t know why they’re running
I take my time to the finish line, cause we all end up with nothing

[Chorus]
I don’t know why, know why
Everybody wanna die rich
Diamonds, champagne
Work your way down that list
We try, everybody tries
Tries to fit into that ditch
You can’t take it with you when you go
Never seen a hearse with a trailer hitch
Never seen a hearse with a trailer hitch

[Verse 2]
Started my day, giving away
All of my baseball cards
It felt so good by the afternoon, I gave some guy my car
It ain’t about what you’re driving
Or about the gold you’re piling
The less I have to worry about
The more time I got for smiling

[Chorus 2]
Don’t know why, know why
Everybody wanna die rich
Champagne, new plane, work your way down that list
We try, everybody tries
Tries to fit into that ditch
Can't take it with you when you go
Never seen a hearse with a trailer hitch
Never seen a hearse with a trailer hitch

[Bridge]
You can stack it up, pack it up
Tie it with a big red bow
Get a great big truck
Back it all up, but you can’t take it with you when you go
Can't take it when you go

[Chorus 3]
I don’t know why, know why
Everybody wanna die rich
Diamonds, champagne, newest of the new planes, work your way down that list and
We try, everybody tries
Tries to fit into that ditch
Can't take it with you when you go
Never seen a hearse with a trailer hitch
Never seen a hearse with a trailer hitch

Hey ey
Hey ey
Give it away
Hey ey
Give it away
