[Verse 1]
Lookin' back on the memory of
The dance we shared, beneath the stars above
For a moment all the world was right
How could I have known that you'd ever say goodbye

[Chorus]
And now, I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end, the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd of had to miss the dance

[Verse 2]
Holding you, I held everything
For a moment, wasn't I the king
But if I'd only known how the king would fall
Hey, who's to say, you know I might have changed it all

[Chorus]
And now, I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end, the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd of had to miss the dance

[Outro]
Yes, my life, it's better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd of had to miss the dance
