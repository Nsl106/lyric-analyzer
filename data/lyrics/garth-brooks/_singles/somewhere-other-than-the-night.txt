[Verse 1]
He could see the storm clouds rollin' across the hill
He barely beat the rain in from the field
And between the backdoor slammin' she heard him say
"Damn this rain and damn this wasted day"

[Verse 2]
But she'd been waitin' for this day for oh-so-long
She was standin' in the kitchen with nothin' but her apron on
And in disbelief he stood and he stared a while
But when their eyes met, they both began to smile

[Chorus]
Somewhere other than the night
She needs to hear I love you
Somewhere other than the night
She needs to know you care
And she wants to know she's needed
And she needs to be held tight
Somewhere other than the night

[Verse 3]
They spent the day wrapped up in a blanket on the front porch swing
He'd come to realize he'd neglected certain things
And there are times she feels alone even by his side
It was the first time, she ever saw him cry

[Chorus]
Somewhere other than the night
She needs to hear I love you
Somewhere other than the night
She needs to know you care
And she wants to know she's needed
And she needs to be held tight
Somewhere other than the night

[Outro]
To know she's needed
She needs to be held tight
Somewhere other than the night
