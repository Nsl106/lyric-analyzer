[Verse 1]
She's sun and rain, she's fire and ice
A little crazy, but it's nice
And when she gets mad, you best leave her alone
'Cause she'll rage just like a river
Then she'll beg you to forgive her
Oh, she's every woman that I've ever known

[Verse 2]
She's so New York and then L.A
And every town along the way
And she's every place that I've never been
She's makin' love on rainy nights
She's a stroll through Christmas lights
And she's everything I wanna do again

[Chorus]
And it needs no explanation
'Cause it all makes perfect sense
For when it comes down to temptation
She's on both sides of the fence
No, it needs no explanation
'Cause it all makes perfect sense
When it comes down to temptation
She's on both sides of the fence

[Verse 3]
She's anything but typical
She's so unpredictable
Oh, but even at her worst, she ain't that bad
She's as real as real can be
And she's every fantasy
Lord, she's every lover that I've ever had

[Outro]
And she's every lover that I've never had
