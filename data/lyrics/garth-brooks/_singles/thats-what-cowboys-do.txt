[Verse 1]
She told me she was lonely and it would be alright
If happy ever after only meant one night
So, we saddled up in satin and rode off for the mornin' sun
Oh, but somewhere 'tween the neon and the mornin' skies
I saw that I was fallin' for those deep blue eyes
And I couldn't help but wonder, "Could this woman be the one?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Then it came to the leavin' part
When sleepin' beauty nearly had my heart

[Chorus]
But a cowboy's always got somewhere to go
Another song to sing, another day to save, another rodeo
They're always leavin' town, chasin' sunsets down, it ain't nothin' new
Yeah, they're just passin' through, that's what cowboys do

[Verse 2]
I knew that I was in for one hell of a ride
As I drew a bull so cruel they call him Satan's Pride
And the odds of gettin' even started seemin' mighty thin
So, I gave the nod and everybody held on tight
Went dancin' with the devil on a Friday night
Whenever you're in Texas, the cowboy's gonna always win

[Pre-Chorus]
Then it came to the leavin' part
Well, leavin' Texas always breaks my heart

[Chorus]
But a cowboy's always got somewhere to go
Another song to sing, another day to save, another rodeo
They're always leavin' town, chasin' sunsets down, it ain't nothin' new
Yeah, they're just passin' through, that's what cowboys do

[Outro]
They're always leavin' town, chasin' sunsets down, sayin' adios to you
Yeah, we're just passin' through, that's what cowboys do
