[Verse 1]
I burned my hand and I cut my face
Heaven knows how long it's been
Since I've felt so out of place
Wonderin' if I would fit in
Debbie and Charlie said they'd be here by nine
And Deb said she might bring a friend
Just my luck, they're right on time
So, here I go again

[Chorus]
And I'm gonna smile my best smile
And I'm gonna laugh like it's goin' out of style
Look into her eyes and pray, that she don't see
That learning to live again is killin' me

[Verse 2]
A little cafe, a table for four
But there's just conversation for three
I like the way she let me get the door
And I wonder what she thinks of me
Debbie just whispered, "You're doin' fine"
And I wish that I felt the same
She's asked me to dance, now her hand's in mine
Oh, my God, I've forgotten her name

[Chorus]
But I'm gonna smile my best smile
And I'm gonna laugh like it's goin' out of style
Look into her eyes and pray, that she don't see
This learning to live again is killin' me

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Now here we are, beneath her porch light
And I say, "What a great time it's been"
A kiss on the cheek, a whisper,  "Goodnight"
And I say, "Can I see you again?"
And she just smiles her best smile
And she laughs like it's goin' out of style
Looks into my eyes and says, "We'll see"
Oh, this learning to live again, is killin' me

[Outro]
God, this learning to live again, is killin' me
