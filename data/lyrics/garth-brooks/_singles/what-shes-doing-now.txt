[Verse 1]
Last time I saw her it was turnin' colder
But that was years ago
Last I heard she had moved to Boulder
But where she's now I don't know
But there's somethin' 'bout this time of year
That spins my head around
Takes me back and makes me wonder
What's she doin' now?

[Chorus]
'Cause what she's doin' now is tearin' me apart
Fillin' up my mind and emptyin' my heart
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows
And I wonder if she knows, what she's doin' now

[Verse 2]
Just for laughs, I dialed her old number
But no one knew her name
Hung up the phone, sat there and wondered
If she'd ever done the same
I took a walk in the evenin' wind
To clear my head somehow
But tonight, I lie here thinkin'
What's she doin' now?

[Chorus]
'Cause what she's doin' now, is tearin' me apart
Fillin' up my mind, and emptyin' my heart
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows
And I wonder if she knows...

[Outro]
That what she’s doin' now, is tearin' me apart
Fillin' up my mind, and emptyin' my heart
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows
And I wonder if she knows, what she’s doin' now
