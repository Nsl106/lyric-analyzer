[Chorus]
Longneck bottle let go of my hand
Hey jukebox don't start playing that song again
'Cause there's a girl at home who loves me
You know she won't understand
Longneck bottle let go of my hand

[Verse 1]
Hey barroom mirror on the wall
Go stare at someone else
Don't show the world the fool I am
Just keep it to yourself

[Chorus]
Longneck bottle let go of my hand
Whoa, jukebox don't start playing that song again
'Cause there's a girl at home who loves me
You know she won't understand
Longneck bottle let go of my hand
Let it go

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Hey, dance floor, seems you're underneath my feet
Everywhere I turn
I ought to waltz right out of them swingin' doors
But that's a step I just can't learn

[Chorus]
Longneck bottle let go of my hand
Hey, jukebox don't start playin' that song again
'Cause there's a girl at home who loves me
You know she won't understand
Longneck bottle let go of my hand

[Outro]
There's a girl at home who loves me
You know she won't understand
Longneck bottle let go of my hand
