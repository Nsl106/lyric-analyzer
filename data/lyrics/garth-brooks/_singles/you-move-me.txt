[Verse 1]
This is how it seems to me
Life is only therapy
Real expensive
And no guarantee
So I lie here on the couch
With my heart hanging out
Frozen solid with fear
Like a rock in the ground

[Chorus]
But you move me
You give me courage I didn't know I had
You move me on
I can't go with you and stay where I am
So you move me on

[Verse 2]
This is how love was to me
I could look and not see
Going through the emotions
Not knowing what they mean
And it scared me so much
That I just wouldn't budge
I might have stayed there forever
If not for your touch

[Chorus]
Oh but you move me
Out of myself and into the fire
You move me
Now I'm burning with love
And with hope and desire
How you move me

[Verse 3]
You go whistling in the dark
Making light of it [x2]
And I follow with my heart
Laughing all the way...

[Chorus]
Oh because you move me
You get me dancing and you make me sing
You move me
Now I'm taking delight
In every little thing
How you move me...

Whoa you move me x4
