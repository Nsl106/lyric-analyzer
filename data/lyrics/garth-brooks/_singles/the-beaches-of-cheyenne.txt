[Verse 1]
They packed up all his buckles
And shipped his saddle to his dad
And by the way the house looked
She must have took it bad
The workers come on Monday
To fix the door and patch the wall
They say she just went crazy
The night she got the call

[Verse 2]
Well, he was up in Wyoming
And drew a bull no man could ride
He promised her he'd turn out
Well, it turned out that he lied
And all the dreams that they'd been livin'
In the California sand
Died right there beside him in Cheyenne

[Chorus 1]
They say she just went crazy
Screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean
And to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water
You'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

[Verse 3]
They never found her body
Just her diary by the bed
It told about the fight they had
And the words that she had said
When he told her he was ridin'
She said, "Then I don't give a damn
If you never come back from Cheyenne"

[Chorus 1]
They say she just went crazy
Screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean
And to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water
You'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

[Chorus 2]
Nobody can explain it
Some say she's still alive
They've even claimed they've seen her
On the shoreline late at night
'Cause if you go down by the water
You'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

[Outro]
Yes, every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne
