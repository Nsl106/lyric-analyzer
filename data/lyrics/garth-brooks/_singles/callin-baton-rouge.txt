[Verse 1]
I spent last night in the arms of a girl in Louisiana
And though I'm out on the highway, my thoughts are still with her
Such a strange combination of a woman and a child
Such a strange situation stoppin' every hundred miles, callin' Baton Rouge

[Verse 2]
A replay of last night's events roll through my mind
Except a scene or two, erased by sweet red wine
And I see a truck stop sign ahead so I change lanes
I need a cup of coffee and a couple dollars change, callin' Baton Rouge

[Chorus]
Operator, won't you put me on through
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge
Hurry up, won't you put her on the line
I gotta talk to the girl just one more time

[Verse 3]
Hello, Samantha dear, I hope you're feelin' fine
And it won't be long until I'm with you all the time
But until then I'll spend my money up, right down to my last dime
Callin' Baton Rouge

[Chorus]
Operator, won't you put me on through
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge
Hurry up, won't you put her on the line
I gotta talk to the girl just one more time

[Outro]
Callin' Baton Rouge
Sweet Baton Rouge
My Baton Rouge
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
