[Verse 1]
Somebody's gotta start the weekend
Somebody's got to unwind
Somebody's gotta find that honky-tonk
Out on the county line
With pretty things and a band that swings
That gets 'em all out on the floor
And if we're gonna get the party started
Somebody's gotta swing them doors

[Chorus]
Somebody's gotta feed that jukebox
Somebody's gotta drink that beer
Somebody's gotta get all rowdy
And raise some hell in here
Somebody's gotta dance with the women
Spin 'em to a country song
I can do this nightlife all day long

[Verse 2]
Somebody's gonna need a shoulder
When that sad song plays
Somebody's gonna need to hold her
Tell her it's okay
Just let her know to let it go
And then she's gonna have some fun
If she needs some help gettin' over him
Somebody's gotta get it done

[Chorus]
Somebody's gotta shoot that whiskey
Somebody gotta bust that rack
Somebody's gotta play that country
That ain't ever comin' back
If home is where the heart is
Then I'm right where I belong
I can do this nightlife all day long

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Somebody's gotta go the distance
Somebody's gotta call last round
Somebody's gotta turn the lights on
And shut this ol' bar down
When mornin' comes you'll find someone
With a headache and a grin
You know Saturday night is comin'
Somebody's gotta go again

[Chorus]
Somebody's gotta feed that jukebox
Somebody's gotta hold my beer
Somebody's gotta get a little crazy
And raise some hell in here
Somebody's gotta spend that paycheck
'Til the money's gone
I can do this nightlife all day long

[Outro]
I can do this nightlife (Let me hear you say) all day long
(Yeah!)
