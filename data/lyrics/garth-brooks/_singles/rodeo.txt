[Verse 1]
His eyes are cold and restless
An' his wounds have almost healed
And she'd give half of Texas
Just to change the way he feels
She knows his love's in Tulsa
An' she knows he's gonna go
Well, it ain't no woman flesh and blood
It's that damned old rodeo

[Chorus]
Well, it's bulls and blood, it's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles, the gold in the buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps, it's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins, and the joy and the pain
And they call the thing rodeo

[Verse 2]
Well, she does her best to hold him
When his love comes to call
But his need for it controls him
And her back's against the wall
And it's "So long girl, I'll see you"
When it's time for him to go
You know the woman wants her cowboy
Like he wants his rodeo

[Chorus]
Well, it's bulls and blood, it's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles, the gold in the buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps, it's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins, and the joy and the pain
And they call the thing rodeo

[Bridge]
It'll drive a cowboy crazy
It'll drive a man insane
And he'll sell off everything he owns
Just to pay to play the game
And a broken home and some broken bones
Is all he'll have to show
For all the years that he spent chasin'
This dream they call rodeo

[Chorus]
Well, it's bulls and blood, it's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles, the gold in the buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps, it's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins, and the joy and the pain
And they call the thing rodeo

[Outro]
It's the broncs and the blood, it's the steers and the mud
And they call the thing rodeo
