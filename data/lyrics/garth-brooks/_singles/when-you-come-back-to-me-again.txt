[Verse 1]
There's a ship out on the ocean
At the mercy of the sea
It's been tossed about, lost and broken
Wandering aimlessly
And God somehow you know that ship
Is me

[Verse 2]
'Cause there's a lighthouse, in a harbor
Shining faithfully
Pouring its light out, across the water
For this sinking soul to see
That someone out there still believes
In me

[Chorus]
On a prayer, in a song
I hear your voice and it keeps me hangin' on, on
Rainin' down, against the wind
I'm reachin' out, 'til we reach the circle's end
When you come back to me again

[Verse 3]
There's a moment, that we all come to
In our own time, and our own space
Where all that we've done, we can undo
If our heart's in the right place

[Chorus]
On a prayer, in a song
I hear your voice and it keeps me hangin' on, on
Rainin' down, against the wind
I'm reachin' out, 'til we reach the circle's end
And you come back to me again

[Bridge]
And again I see, my yesterday's in front of me
Unfolding like a mystery, you're changin' all that is and used to be

[Chorus]
On a prayer, in a song
I hear your voice and it keeps me hangin' on
Rainin' down, against the wind
I'm reachin' out, 'til we reach the circle's end
When you come back to me again
When you come back to me again
