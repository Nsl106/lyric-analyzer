[Verse 1]
Yeah, she's my lady luck, hey, I'm her wild card man
Together we're buildin' up a real hot hand
We live out in the country, hey, she's my little queen of the South
Yeah, we're two of a kind, workin' on a full house

[Verse 2]
She wakes me every mornin' with a smile and a kiss
Her strong country lovin' is hard to resist
She's my easy lovin' woman, I'm her hard-workin' man, no doubt
Yeah, we're two of a kind, workin' on a full house

[Bridge]
Yeah, our pickup truck is her limousine
And her favorite dress is her faded blue jeans
She loves me tender when the goin' gets tough
Sometimes we fight just so we can make up

[Verse 3]
Lord, I need that little woman like the crops need the rain
She's my honeycomb and I'm her sugar cane
We really fit together, if you know what I'm talkin' about
Yeah, we're two of a kind, workin' on a full house

[Bridge]
This time I found a keeper, I made up my mind
Lord, the perfect combination is her heart and mine
The sky's the limit, no hill is too steep
We're playin' for fun, but we're playin' for keeps

[Verse 4]
So, draw the curtain, honey, turn the lights down low
We'll find some country music on the radio
I'm yours and you're mine, hey, that's what it's all about
Yeah, we're two of a kind, workin' on a full house

[Outro]
Lordy, mama, we'll be two of a kind, workin' on a full house
