[Verse 1]
She always says that I'm the rock that she leans on
But it's so hard to believe
'Cause she is always there when I start losin' faith and goin' crazy
She saves me

[Verse 2]
And every now and then she just wants me to hold her
Whoa, but that don't mean she's weak
The way she unafraid to let her feelings show
Just means she stronger than me

[Chorus]
She lifts the weight of this whole world off of my shoulders
With nothin' but the touch of her hand yeah
And every day I wake up and she tells me that she loves me
I feel more like a man

[Verse 3]
You know I always thought I had to have the answers
Be her strength and take the lead
But when it comes to everything that really matters
She's stronger than me

[Chorus]
She lifts the weight of this whole world off of my shoulders
With nothin' but the touch of her hand
And every day I wake up and I tell her that I love her
I feel more like a man

[Outro]
And I'd give her anything in life that's mine to give her
'Til the last breath that I breathe
And if I have a choice, I pray God takes me first
'Cause she's stronger than me
