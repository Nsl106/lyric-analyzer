[Verse 1]
This old highway's gettin' longer
It seems there is no end in sight
To sleep would be best
But I just can't afford to rest
I gotta ride in Denver tomorrow night

[Verse 2]
I called the house but no one answered
For the last two weeks no one's been home
I guess she's through with me
To tell the truth I just can't see
What's kept the woman holdin' on this long

[Chorus]
And the white line's getting longer
And the saddle's gettin' cold
And I'm much too young to feel this damn old
All my cards are on the table
With no ace left in the hole
And I'm much too young to feel this damn old

[Verse 3]
The competition's gettin' younger
Tougher broncs, you know I can't recall
A worn out tape of Chris LeDoux
Lonely women and bad booze
Seem to be the only friends I've left at all

[Chorus]
And the white line's getting longer
And the saddle's gettin' cold
And I'm much too young to feel this damn old
All my cards are on the table
With no ace left in the hole
And I'm much too young to feel this damn old

[Outro]
Lord, I'm much too young to feel this damn old
