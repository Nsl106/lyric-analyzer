[Verse 1]
He followed her to work this mornin
He'd never seen that dress before
And she seemed to sail right through those dark clouds forming
That he knows he's headed for
After seven years of marriage
He wanted out
Now after seven months of freedom
It's clear that there's no doubt

[Chorus]
She's gonna make it and he never will
He's at the foot of the mountain, she's over that hill
He's sinkin' at sea and her sails are filled
She's gonna make it and he never will

[Verse 2]
No, It's not like she's forgot about him
She's just dealin' with the pain
And the fact that she's survived so well without him
You know it's drivin' him insane
And the crazy thing about it
Is she'd take him back
But the fool in him that walked out
Is the fool that just won't ask

[Chorus]
She's gonna make it and he never will
He's at the foot of the mountain, she's over that hill
He's sinkin' at sea and her sails are filled
She's gonna make it and he never will

[Outro]
Lord, she's gonna make it, he never will
