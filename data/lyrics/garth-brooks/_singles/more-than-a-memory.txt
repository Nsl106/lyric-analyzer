[Verse 1]
People say she's only in my head
It's gonna take time but I'll forget
They say I need to get on with my life
But they don't realize

[Chorus]
Is when you're dialin' six numbers just to hang up the phone
Drivin' 'cross town just to see if she's home
Wakin' a friend in the dead of the night
Just to hear him say it's gonna be alright
When you're findin' things to do not to fall asleep
Because you know she'll be there in your dreams
That's when she's
More than a memory

[Verse 2]
Took a match to everything she ever wrote
Watched her words go up in smoke
Tore all her pictures off the wall
That ain't helpin' me at all

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're talkin' out loud but nobody's there
You look like hell and you just don't care
Drinkin' more than you ever drank
Sinkin' down lower than you ever sank
When you find yourself fallin' down upon your knees
Prayin' to God, beggin' him, please
That's when she's
More than a memory

[Bridge]
She's more
She's more

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're dialin' her number just to hang up the phone
Drivin' 'cross town just to see if she's home
Wakin' a friend in the dead of night
Just to hear him say it's gonna be alright
When you're findin' things to do not to fall asleep
'Cause you know she's waiting in your dreams
That's when she's more than a memory

[Outro]
People say she's only in my head
It's gonna take time but I'll forget
