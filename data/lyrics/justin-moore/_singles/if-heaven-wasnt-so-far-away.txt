[Verse 1]
Every day I drive to work across Flint River Bridge
A hundred yards from the spot
Where me and grandpa fished
There's a piece of his old fruit stand
On the side of Sawmill Road
He'd be there peeling peaches
If it was twenty years ago

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And what I wouldn't give
To ride around in that old truck with him

[Chorus]
If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce 'em to their grandpa
Watch 'em laugh at the way he talks
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Tell him we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror, we'd all watch 'em wave
Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far away

[Verse 2]
I'd hug all three of those girls
We lost from the class of '99
And I'd find my bird dog Bo
And take him huntin' one more time
Ask Hank why he took those pills back in '53
And Janis to sing the second verse of
"Me and Bobby McGee"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Sit on a cloud and visit for a while
It'd do me good just to see them smile

[Chorus]
If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce 'em to their grandpa
Watch 'em laugh at the way he talks
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Tell him we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror, we'd all watch them wave
Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far
If heaven wasn't so far
If heaven wasn't so far away

[Outro]
So far away
So far away
