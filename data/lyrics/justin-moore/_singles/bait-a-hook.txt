[Verse 1]
I heard you had to drive him home after two umbrella drinks
I heard he's got a Prius, 'cause he's into being green
My buddy said he saw y'all eatin' that sushi stuff
Baby, that don't sound like you, that don't sound like love
Sounds like it sucks

[Chorus]
He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line
But not the kind in a field and stream book
No darlin' I ain't even worried, you'll come runnin' back
He can't even bait a hook

[Verse 2]
Has he kissed you in a hay field as the summer rain falls down?
Has he took you to meet his mama back in his hometown?
Does he drive the interstate or does he take them ole back roads?
Can he melt your heart with a country song every good ole boy should know?
I didn't think so

[Chorus]
He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line
But not the kind in a field and stream book
No darlin' I ain't even worried, you'll come runnin' back
He can't even bait a hook

[Bridge]
It won't be that long, until you start getting bored
I'll be smilin' on the river, reelin' in one more

[Chorus]
He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line
But not the kind in a field and stream book
No darlin' I ain't even worried, you'll come runnin' back
He can't even bait a hook

[Outro]
No baby I ain't even worried
He can't even bait a hook
