[Verse 1]
I rolled my daddy's truck off the Dixonville curve after drinking my fifth beer
And I fed hogs trying to pay him off for most of my senior year
I got my jaw jacked by a big ole boy for messing 'round with his girlfriend
But she was tall and tan and she kissed just right but I'll never do that again

[Chorus]
Yeah, I've done some pretty stupid things but hey
I'm a little bit harder and whole lot smarter
That's how I got to be this way

[Verse 2]
I've been kicked in the face by horse 'cause I ran up too fast behind him
And I shook hands on a deal with a man, and found out he was lying
I've broken a couple good girls hearts 'cause I said I loved 'em knowing I couldn't
An I've given my heart to a woman who said she'd stay, when I knew she wouldn't

[Chorus]
Yeah, I've done some pretty stupid things but hey
I'm a little bit harder and whole lot smarter
That's how I got to be this way

[Bridge]
I've been bit I've been burned
But I've lived and I've learned from it
I've made some mistakes but that's what it takes to make a man out of a kid

[Chorus]
Yeah, I've done some pretty stupid things but hey
I'm a little bit harder and whole lot smarter
That's how I got to be this way

[Chorus]
Yeah, I've done some pretty stupid things but hey, hey, hey
I'm a little bit harder and whole lot smarter
That's how I got to be this way

[Outro]
That's how I've got to be this, how I've got to be this
How I've got to be this way...
Hey!
