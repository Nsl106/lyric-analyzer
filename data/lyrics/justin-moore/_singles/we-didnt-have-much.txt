[Verse 1]
Tonka trucks and G.I. Joes
Jumping those hills with Luke and Bo
Plastic cap guns and a swimming hole
Don't get no dirt on your church clothes
Win or lose, we cheer for the Braves
Ten percent in the offering plate
Sunday chicken and a NASCAR race
Sure'd be nice to get back to that place

[Chorus]
There was dirt on daddy's clothes
From putting that bacon on mama's stove
Dog barking in the yard at a truck we don't know
All we had was us
And that little bitty house and a lotta love
We had it all when we didn't have much

[Verse 2]
Eighteen, left it all behind
Chasing a girl, chasing a dime
Went so far tryna get mine
I can't see that old porch light
That led me home at night

[Chorus]
There was dirt on daddy's clothes
From putting that bacon on mama's stove
Dog barking in the yard at a truck we don't know
All we had was us
And that little bitty house and a lotta love
We had it all when we didn't have much
When we didn't have much

[Bridge]
I can still hear grandma reading
That red letter Book of John
I can still smell coffee in the kitchen
With ol' Don Williams on

[Chorus]
And there was dirt on daddy's clothes
From putting that bacon on mama's stove
Dog barking in the yard at a truck we don't know
All we had was us
And that little bitty house and a lotta love
We had it all when we didn't have much
Had it all when we didn't have much
Little bitty house and a lotta love
We had it all when we didn't have much
