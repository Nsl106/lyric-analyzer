[Verse 1]
Rifle in a gun rack hanging in the back glass
Buck knife on my belt, ain't no land for sale 'round here
Red clay country mud, sipping on a cold Bud
Blue tick coon hound you know where I'm found

[Chorus]
Out in the backwoods down in the holler
Out in the backwoods, working hard for a dollar
In the backwoods, yeah, we get it done right
Work hard, play hard, hold my baby tight
Lordy have mercy it's a real good life
In the backwoods, yes sir

[Verse 2]
Preacher's daughter couldn't get hotter
Floating that river on an inner tube with her, splash
35's and a lift kit how stuck can you get
Ain't that just my luck where's the chain I'm stuck

[Chorus]
Out in the backwoods down in the holler
Out in the backwoods, working hard for a dollar
In the backwoods, yeah, we get it done right
Work hard, play hard, hold my baby tight
Lordy have mercy it's a real good life
In the backwoods, yes sir

Out in the backwoods down in the holler
Out in the backwoods, working hard for a dollar
In the backwoods, yeah, we get it done right
Work hard, play hard, hold my baby tight
Lordy have mercy it's a real good life
In the backwoods, down in the holler son
Down in the backwoods
