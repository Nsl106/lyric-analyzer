[Verse 1]
How can I be sure you're being honest with me?
Can I take your love for true?
There comes a time in every man's life
When he needs a little proof
So show me something different
Something I ain't never seen before

[Chorus]
This time instead of gettin' up and goin' home to him
Just get up and close the door
Just get up and close the door

[Verse 2]
And say you'll stay with me tonight
Say you won't regret morning light
Then I'll believe the words of love you've said to me before
If you'll just get up and close the door

[Chorus]
This time instead of getting up and goin' home to him
Just get up and close the door
