[Verse 1]
I was foolin' when I said I'd always love you
Just foolin' when I said that I'd be true

[Verse 2]
Now you're gone there's an achin' that I can't seem to lose
And I wonder was I ever foolin' you

[Verse 3]
And now that I realize I can't have you
It's finally dawned on me just who the fool could be

[Chorus]
But this time believe me I'm not foolin' you
I just can't talk my heart into unlovin' you

[Verse 3]
And now that I realize that I can't have you
It's finally dawned on me just who the fool could be

[Chorus]
But this time believe me I'm not foolin you
I just can't talk my heart into unlovin' you
This time believe me I'm not foolin' you
I just can't talk my heart into unlovin' you
