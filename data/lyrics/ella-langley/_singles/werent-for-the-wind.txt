[Verse 1]
I wouldn't paint me as a heartbreaker
But I've said a few goodbyes
I'd make a promise but I know later
I'm bound to change my mind
Depending on the weather, I'm goin'
Hell, baby, nobody knows when
Yeah, if it was a different time
Might've been different in a different life

[Chorus]
Maybe that plane wouldn't ever take off
Maybe that dust wouldn't fly off the drive
Maybe that tumbleweed and me
Wouldn't leave every other sunrise
Maybe I'd settle down, dig in some roots
Find me a farmhouse, find me you
Maybe I wouldn't be already gone again
If it weren't for the wind

[Verse 2]
I wouldn't stay wonderin' what's out there
I wouldn't saddle up on a breeze
I wouldn't disappear out of thin air
I could put down these wings

[Chorus]
Maybe that plane wouldn't ever take off
Maybe that dust wouldn't fly off the drive
Maybe that tumbleweed and me
Wouldn't leave every other sunrise
Maybe I'd settle down, dig in some roots
Find me a farmhouse, find me you
Maybe I wouldn't be already gone again
If it weren't for the wind

[Post-Chorus]
Blowin', carryin' me to the wide open
White lines rollin' and the tires smokin'
It wouldn't be the rearview I'm lookin' in
If it weren't for the wind
If it weren't for the wind

[Chorus]
Maybe that plane wouldn't ever take off
Maybe that dust wouldn't fly off the drive
Maybe that tumbleweed and me
Wouldn't leave every other sunrise
Maybe I'd settle down, dig in some roots
Find me a farmhouse, find me you
Maybe I wouldn't be already gone again
If it weren't for the wind

[Post-Chorus]
Blowin', carryin' me to the wide open
White lines rollin' and the tires smokin'
It wouldn't be the rearview lookin' in
If it weren't for the wind

[Outro]
If it weren't for the wind
