[Verse 1: Ella Langley]
I was all but twenty-two, I think at the time
I'd been out on the road lonely at night
And it'd been a while, huh, so it was on my mind
Well, I saw him walk in with his cowboy hat
And I thought to myself, "I could use some of that"
His boots like glass on a sawdust floor, huh
Had moves like nothin' I'd ever seen before
So I walked right up, and I pulled him to the side
I handed that man a beer and looked him in the eyes
And I said, "Baby, I think you're gonna wanna hear this"
Then I told him

[Chorus: Ella Langley]
"Excuse me
You look like you love me
You look like you want me to want you to come on home
And, baby, I don't blame you
For lookin' me up and down across this room
I'm drunk and I'm ready to leavе
And you look like you love me"

[Verse 2: Riley Green]
Wеll, I was down at a local beer joint with a few of the guys
When this cute little country girl caught my eye
And, boy, let me tell you
She was the prettiest thing I'd ever seen in a pair of boots
Well, she walked right up to me, handed me a beer
Gave me a look like, "Let's get outta here"
And that's when I realized that she was every cowboy's dream come true
She told me this right here
She said

[Chorus: Ella Langley & Riley Green, Ella Langley]
"Excuse me
You look like you love me
You look like you want me to want you to come on home
And, baby, I don't blame you
For lookin' me up and down across this room
I'm drunk and I'm ready to leave
And you look like you love me"
Alright, now

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge: Ella Langley]
So if you ever see a man in a cowboy hat
And you think to yourself, "I could use some of that"
Don't waste your time
Just give him this here line
Goes a little like this

[Chorus: Ella Langley, Ella Langley & Riley Green]
"Excuse me
You look like you love me
You look like you want me to want you to come on home
And, baby, I don't blame you
For lookin' me up and down across this room
I'm drunk and I'm ready to leave
And you look like you love me
I'm drunk and I'm ready to leave
And you look like you love me"
