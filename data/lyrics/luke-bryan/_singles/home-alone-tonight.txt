[Intro: Karen Fairchild & Luke Bryan]
Oh
Oh

[Verse 1: Luke Bryan & Karen Fairchild]
What you doing in this place?
Well, I could probably ask you the same thing
Another round, girl, what you think?
If you're buying, well, you know I'll drink
So make it seven on seven
Do you want it on the rocks?
A double shot of heaven
Spilling out the top

[Chorus: Luke Bryan & Karen Fairchild, Karen Fairchild & Luke Bryan]
And we'll go shot for shot for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock that's gonna stop
A night we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
I'll send it to my ex, I'll send it to my ex
And send 'em both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl, you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight

[Verse 2: Luke Bryan & Karen Fairchild]
Slow country from a cover band
I got you covered if you don't know how to dance
But if you want, we could grab a cab
Girl, we got all night, I got a bottomless tab

[Chorus: Luke Bryan & Karen Fairchild, Karen Fairchild & Luke Bryan]
So let's go shot for shot for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock that's gonna stop
A night we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
I'll send it to my ex, I'll send it to my ex
And send 'em both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl, you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight

[Bridge: Luke Bryan & Karen Fairchild, Luke Bryan & Karen Fairchild]
It feels too good to let it end right here
I ain't going home alone tonight
So let's not let it end, let it end right here
Girl, you're going home with me tonight

[Chorus: Luke Bryan & Karen Fairchild, Karen Fairchild & Luke Bryan]
So let's go shot for shot for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock that's gonna stop
A night we won't regret
Put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
I'll send it to my ex, I'll send it to my ex
And send 'em both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl, you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight

[Outro: Karen Fairchild, Luke Bryan, Luke Bryan & Karen Fairchild]
No, I ain't going home alone tonight
Girl, you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight
Baby, don't let me go home alone
Home alone tonight
