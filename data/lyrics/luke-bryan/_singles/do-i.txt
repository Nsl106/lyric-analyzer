[Verse 1]
Baby, what are we becomin'?
It feels just like we're always runnin'
Rollin' through the motions every day

[Verse 2]
I could lean in to hold you
Or act like I don't even know you
Seems like you could care less either way

[Pre-Chorus]
What happened to that girl I used to know?
I just want us back to the way we were before

[Chorus]
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wantin' you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby?
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Baby, do I?

[Verse 3]
Remember when we didn't have nothin'
But a perfect simple kind of lovin'?
Baby, those sure were the days

[Pre-Chorus]
There was a time our love ran wild and free
But now I'm second guessin' everything I see

[Chorus]
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wantin' you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Baby, do I

[Bridge]
Still give you what you need?
Still take your breath away?
Light up the spark way down deep?
Baby, do I?!

[Chorus]
Whoa! Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wantin' you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Tell me, baby, do I get one more try?
Do I?
Baby, do I?
