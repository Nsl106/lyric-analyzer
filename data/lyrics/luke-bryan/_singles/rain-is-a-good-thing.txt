[Verse 1]
My daddy spent his life lookin' up at the sky
He'd cuss, kick the dust, sayin', "Son, it's way too dry"
It clouds up in the city, the weatherman complains
But where I come from, rain is a good thing

[Chorus]
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby feel a little frisky
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies piled up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take 'em into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing like a kiss out back in the barn
Wringing out our soakin' clothes, ridin' out a thunderstorm
When the tin roof gets to talkin', that's the best love we make
Yeah, where I come from, rain is a good thing

[Chorus]
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby feel a little frisky
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies piled up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take 'em into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

[Bridge]
Farmer Johnson does a little dance
Creeks on the rise, roll up yo pants
Country girls, they want to cuddle
Kids out playin' in a big mud puddle

[Chorus]
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby— Hahahaha
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies piled up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

[Outro]
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing
