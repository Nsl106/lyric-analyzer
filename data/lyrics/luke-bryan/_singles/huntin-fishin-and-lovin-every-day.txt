[Intro]
Woah, woah-whoa
Mm-mm

[Verse 1]
If I could make a livin' from walkin' in the woods
You can bet I'd be sittin' pretty good
High on a hill lookin' at a field downwind
If I could make a nickel off of turning 'em bass
Never worry 'bout the price of gas
I'd be wheelin' and dealin' and sittin' there reelin' 'em in

[Chorus]
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God, He made me this way
Huntin', and fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the mornin', late in the evenin'
I'm gettin' red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day

[Verse 2]
I get a little Farm Pond buzz
Sound of gravel when I'm backin' up
Pullin' the string on a nine point nine two-stroke, Mercury
I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree
Tuckin' her hair in my hat, and she's ready to go

[Chorus]
And we get to huntin', fishin', lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God, He made me this way
Huntin', and fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the mornin', late in the evenin'
I'm getting red dirt rich, and Flint River paid
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day, yeah
Woo

[Bridge]
So while y'all are up there
Breathin' in that old dirty air
I'll be down here, knee-deep, in the Muckalee (Ha)
Huntin' and fishin', lovin' every day
I wanna see them tall pines sway
Y'all close them eyes
Let's go there in our mind

[Chorus]
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer this country boy prays
Thank God, He made me this way
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
Black coffee in the mornin', dark whiskey in the evenin'
I'm gettin' red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day (Woo)
Come on

[Outro]
Won't you come along with me
Won't you come along with me
I know you wanna see
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day, yeah
