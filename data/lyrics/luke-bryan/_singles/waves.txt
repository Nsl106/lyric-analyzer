[Verse 1]
It's like the sun went down just to frame your face
Like they played that song just to see you sway
Like that old surf shop had you in mind
With what you got on, makin' those tan lines
It's like the ocean knows we're layin'
On this beach tonight
It's like the sand's been waitin'
For you to come alive 'cause

[Chorus]
You were made for summer
Just like these stars we're under
Were made for lightin' this July sky up
Blanket down made for me and you tied up
All night long, over and over
Crash into me and pull mе closer
Kiss by kiss, one after anothеr
Don't let it go, baby, let this summer
Just keep on comin' in waves, keep comin' in waves
Keep on comin' in waves, keep comin' in waves

[Verse 2]
Wish I could bottle up the taste on your lips
That margarita saltwater sunburned sip
It's like I feel that sun right next to me
Yeah, girl, your touch is a hundred degrees
Boardwalks were made for dancin'
And flip flops were made to lose like
This night was meant to happen
And, girl, I was made for you like

[Chorus]
You were made for summer
Just like these stars we're under
Were made for lightin' this July sky up
Blanket down made for me and you tied up
All night long, over and over
Crash into me and pull me closer
Kiss by kiss, one after another
Don't let it go, baby, let this summer
Just keep on comin' in waves, keep comin' in waves
Keep on comin' in waves, keep on comin' in waves

[Bridge]
Keep on comin' in waves, keep on comin' in waves
Keep on comin' in waves

[Chorus]
Baby, you were made for summer
Just like these stars we're under
Were made for lightin' this July sky up
Blanket down made for me and you tied up
All night long, over and over
Crash into me and pull me closer
Kiss by kiss, one after another
Don't let it go, baby, let this summer
Just keep on comin' in waves, keep comin' in waves
Keep on comin' in waves, keep comin' in waves
