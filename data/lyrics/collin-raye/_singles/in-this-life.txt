[Verse 1]
For all I've been blessed with in this life
There was an emptiness in me
I was imprisoned by the power of gold
With one honest touch, you set me free

[Chorus]
Let the world stop turning
Let the sun stop burning
Let them tell me love's not worth
Going through
If it all falls apart
I will know deep in my heart
The only dream that mattered
Had come true
In this life
I was loved by you

[Verse 2]
For every mountain I have climbed
Every raging river crossed
You were the treasure that I longed to find
Without your love I would be lost

[Chorus]
Let the world stop turning
Let the sun stop burning
Let them tell me love's not worth
Going through
If it all falls apart
I will know deep in my heart
The only dream that mattered
Had come true
In this life
I was loved by you

[Outro]
In this life
I was loved by you
