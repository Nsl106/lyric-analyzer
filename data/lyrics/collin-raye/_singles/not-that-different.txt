[Verse 1]
She said "we're much too different, we're from two separate worlds"
And he admitted she was partly right
But in his heart's defense, he told her what they had in common
Was strong enough to bond them for life
He said, "Look behind your own soul and the person that you'll see
Just might remind you of me"

[Chorus]
"I laugh, I love, I hope, I try
I hurt, I need, I fear, I cry
And I know you do the same things too
So we're really not that different, me and you"

[Verse 2]
Now she could hardly argue with his pure and simple logic
But logic never could convince a heart
She had always dreamed of loving someone more exotic
And he just didn't seem to fit the part
So she searched for greener pastures but never could forget
What he whispered when she left

[Chorus]
"I laugh, I love, I hope, I try
I hurt, I need, I fear, I cry
And I know you do the same things, too
So we're really not that different, me and you."

[Bridge]
Was it time or was it truth?
Maybe both led her back to his door
And as her tears fell at his feet
She didn't say "I love you," what she said meant even more

[Chorus]
"I laugh, I love, I hope, I try
I hurt, I need, I fear, I cry
And I know you do the same things, too
So we're really not that different, me and you"
