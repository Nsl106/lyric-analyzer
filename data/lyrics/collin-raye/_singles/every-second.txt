[Verse 1]
Well listen dear, I think it's clear we need to sit and talk
Seems you've got this notion I've been having second thoughts
Well, I must confess, in a way, I guess that silly notion's true
'Cause every second you're not here with me, I think of you

[Chorus]
Every second, every minute, every hour of every day
Every second there's a thought of you that comes my way
So if you ask if I've had second thoughts, I guess I'd have to say
Every second, every minute, every hour of every day

[Verse 2]
Now I propose we drink a toast and turn the lights down low
Put our favorite music on and hold each other close
Don't worry, dear, you'll always be here in my heart to stay
Every second, every minute, every hour of every day

[Chorus]
Every second, every minute, every hour of every day
Every second there's a thought of you that comes my way
So if you ask if I've had second thoughts, I guess I'd have to say
Every second, every minute, every hour of every day

[Refrain]
Every second, every minute, I love you more and more each day
