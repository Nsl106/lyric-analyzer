She met him down at the laundromat;
Three a.m. on a washing machine
They sat and talked 'til dawn

He bought her breakfast at a small cafe
Mornin' turned into the rest of the day
Then the day was gone
He thought that she'd surely run away
No fairy tale ever started this way, but

It ain't the mind that calls the shots 'round here
Stronger powers pull two bodies near
Nothing on earth can interfere when love is
What the heart wants

They made a wish on the evening star
From a rooftop high above the boulevard
Up in the twilight sky

He held her hand, she held her breath
Two lonely hearts beating, scared to death
Of the chance to fly
Givin' in to the arms of fate
This isn't quite like the plans that they made, but

It ain't the mind that calls the shots 'round here
Stronger powers pull two bodies near
Nothing on earth can interfere when love is
What the heart wants

It ain't the mind that calls the shots 'round here
Stronger powers pull two bodies near
Nothing on earth can interfere when love is
What the heart wants

Nothing on earth can interfere when love is...
