[Verse 1]
I've seen that look before
Here comes that doubt again
You think that girl we saw
Was more than just a friend
Yes, there was a time
I thought she had it all
She meant the world to me
Back when the world was small

[Chorus]
That was a river, this is the ocean
That never carried this much emotion
Nothing compares to this deep devotion
That was a river, this is the ocean

[Verse 2]
The love we had before
Can never change this one
We're not imprisoned by
The past we've brought along
It's just you and me
One ship in the night
There are no boundaries
There is no end in sight

[Chorus]
That was a river, this is the ocean
That never carried this much emotion
Nothing compares to this deep devotion
That was a river, this is the ocean

[Outro]
Nothing compares to this deep devotion
That was a river, this is the ocean
That was a river, this is the ocean
