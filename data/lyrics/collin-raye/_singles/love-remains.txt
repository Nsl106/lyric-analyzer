[Verse 1]
We are born one fine day
Children of God on our way
Mama smiles, daddy cries
Miracle before their eyes
They protect us 'til we're of age
And through it all, love remains

[Verse 2]
Boy moves on, takes a bride
She stands faithful by his side
Tears and sweat, they build a home
Raise a family of their own
They share joy and they share pain
Through it all, love remains

[Bridge]
Kingdoms come and go but they don't last
Before you know the future is the past
In spite of what's been lost or what's been gained
We are living proof that love remains

[Verse 3]
I don't know, baby, what I'd do
On this earth without you
We all live, we all die
But the end is not goodbye
The sun comes up and seasons change
Through it all, love remains

[Outro]
An eternal burning flame
Hope lives on and love remains
