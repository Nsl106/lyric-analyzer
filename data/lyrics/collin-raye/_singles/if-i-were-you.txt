You want to know where we go from here
So many roads, but none that seem clear
Is what we have enough to last a whole life through?
Who knows? Baby, who knows?

So you're asking me 'what do we do'?
'Cause time moves so fast, and the chances seem so few
Is it too much to think that we could have it all?
Who knows? We may never know

But if I were you I'd promise to live life for all it's worth
Take all that you've been given and leave your mark upon this earth
Trust your heart to show you everything you'll ever need
And if I were you, I'd fall in love with me

So hold me close, I'll kiss away your fears
I won't promise the moon, but I promise to be here
And what if together it gets better everyday?
Who knows? Baby, who knows?

But if I were you I'd promise to live life for all its worth
Take all that you've been given and leave your mark upon this earth
Trust your heart to show you everything you'll ever need
And if I were you, I'd fall in love with me

But if I were you I'd promise to live life for all its worth
Take all that you've been given and leave your mark upon this earth
Trust your heart to show you everything you'll ever need
And if I were you, I'd fall in love with me

If I were you, I'd fall in love with me
