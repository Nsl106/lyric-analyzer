A Buncha Girls sitting on the deck, drinking fishbowl margaritas
A buncha girls down in Cancun, yeah some seven day senioritas
A buncha girls packed in a jeep, heading to the beach for the weekend
A buncha girls rockin out in Vegas, ain't got no time for sleepin

[Chorus]
A buncha girls lookin for a good time
Breakin hearts, turnin heads and lookin so fine
Nothin drives the boys right out of their mind
Like a buncha girls

They got high-dollar jeans, belly button rings, Pretty pink painted-up toes
They'll drink your drinks, make you think, you're their right now romeo
They say sha-la-la and hey-hey-hey with the band and party all night long
Laugh about it in the mornin, lookin at all the pictures and blame it on alcohol

[Instrumental break]

[repeat Chorus]

A buncha girls gettin buck wild
Rulin the world with a sexy smile
I'd walk a country mile, yes I would
For a buncha girls
For a buncha hot girls
Ha-ha, yeah, yeah, babe

Yeah, yeah
