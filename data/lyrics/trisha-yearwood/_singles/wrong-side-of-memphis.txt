[Chorus]
I've been livin' on the wrong side of Memphis
I'm really breaking away this time
A full tank of gas and a '69 Tempest
Takin' me to that Nashville sign

[Verse 1]
No turning back, I've come too far
Headed down 40 with my old guitar
This ain't Graceland, well, that's a fact
And I ain't driving no pink Cadillac

[Chorus]
I've been livin' on the wrong side of Memphis
Gonna bronze these blue suede shoes
These cowboy boots are gettin' kinda restless
They ain't got a single thing to lose

[Verse 2]
I've had this dream from a tender age
Callin' my name from the Opry stage
I can hear it singin' loud and clear
Two hundred miles and I'll be there

[Chorus]
I've been livin' on the wrong side of Memphis
I'm really breaking away this time
A full tank of gas and a '69 Tempest
Taking me to that Nashville sign
Yes, I've been livin' on the wrong side of Memphis
Gonna bronze these blue suede shoes
These cowboy boots are gettin' kinda restless
They ain't got a single thing to lose

[Outro]
I've been livin' on the wrong side of Memphis
I've been livin' on the wrong side of Memphis
I got the cowboy boots
Rhinestone suit
I've been livin' on the wrong side of Memphis
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Full tank of gas and a '69 Tempest
Takin' me to that Nashville sign
