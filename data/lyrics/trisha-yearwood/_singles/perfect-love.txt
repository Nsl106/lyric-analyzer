[Verse 1]
Sunday mornin' when the paper comes
Let's read it front to back and see what's going on
Drink our coffee by the flower bed and talk about the stuff
That's running through our heads
When you look at me the way you do
I can't help but look right back at you

[Chorus]
Yeah, this is a perfect love
We're doin' nothin' but what a perfect love does
We're not tryin' to make history
It's just you and me
In a perfect love

[Verse 2]
Hey, let's drive to the edge of town
See what there is to see and then turn back around
Stop by and see your mom and dad
And hear 'em talk about the busy week they had
Then let's take a walk beside the lake
See what kinda fun we can make

[Chorus]
Yeah, this is a perfect love
We're doin' nothin' but what a perfect love does
We're not tryin' to make history
It's just you and me
In a perfect love

[Bridge]
Oh, ain't it a perfect love
I know you love me just because

[Chorus]
Yeah, this is a perfect love
We're doin' nothin' but what a perfect love does
We're not tryin' to make history
It's just you and me
In a perfect love

[Outro]
(Oh, ain't it a perfect love)
This is a perfect love
(Oh, ain't it a perfect love)
Ain't it a perfect love
(Oh, ain't it a perfect love)
Yeah, we got a perfect love
