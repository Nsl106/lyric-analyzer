[Verse1 ]
Phone rings, baby cries, TV diet, guru lies
Good morning honey
Go to work, make up, try to keep the balance up
Between love and money

[Chorus]
She used to tie her hair up in ribbons and bows
Sign her letters with X's and O's
Got a picture of her mama in heels and pearls
She's gonna make it in her daddy's world
She's an American girl
An American girl

[Verse 2]
Slow dance
Second chance
Mama needs romance
And an live-in maid
Fix the sink
Mow the yard
Really isn't all that hard
If you get paid

[Chorus]
She used to tie her hair up in ribbons and bows
Sign her letters with X's and O's
Got a picture of her mama in heels and pearls
She's gonna make it in her daddy's world
She's an American girl
An American girl
Well, she's got her God
And she's got good wine
Aretha Franklin and Patsy Cline

[Chorus]
She used to tie her hair up in ribbons and bows
Sign her letters with X's and O's
Got a picture of her mama in heels and pearls
She's gonna make it in her daddy's world
She's an American girl
An American girl
She's an American girl

[Chorus]
She used to tie her hair up in ribbons and bows
Sign her letters with X’s and O’s
Got a picture of her mama in heels and pearls
She's gonna make it in her daddy's world
Well, she tied her hair up in ribbons and bows
Sign her letters with X’s and O’s
X’s and O’s
X’s and O’s
