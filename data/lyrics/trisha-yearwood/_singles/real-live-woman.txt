[Verse 1]
I don't buy the lines in magazines
That tell me what I've gotta be
I don't base my life on a movie screen
I don't fit the mold society has planned
I don't need to be 19 years old
Or starve myself for some weight I'm told
Or turn men's heads down that road
And I thank God I finally know just who I am

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't a movie star
May never see the view from where they are
And this old town may be as far as I'm goin'
And what he'll hold tonight in his hands
He swears there's so much better than
Anything that this old world can show him

[Chorus]
I'm a real (Real) live (Live) woman
In love with this man I see lyin' here next to me
Lost in the way that he's holdin'
This real (Real) live (Live) woman
In the arms of a man where I'll fall asleep
Knowin' there's nothin' on earth he loves more than
This real (Real) live (Live) woman

[Verse 2]
I work 9 to 5 and I can't relate
To millionaires who somehow fate
Has smiled upon and fortune made their
Common lives a better place to be

[Pre-Chorus]
And I no longer justify
Reasons for the way that I behave
I offer no apologies
For the things that I believe and say
And I like it that way

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a real (Real) live (Live) woman
In love with this man I see lyin' here next to me
Lost in the way that he's holdin'
This real (Real) live (Live) woman
In the arms of a man where I'll fall asleep
Knowin' there's nothin' on earth he loves more than
This real (Real) live (Live) woman (Woman)
