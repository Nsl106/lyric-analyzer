I'm the fool who broke the rules
And made your teardrops start
One who used your precious love
And broke your trusting heart

I'm the one who's begging you
To let me come back in
Darling, why can't you and I start over once again?

Over
I can't believe we're really over
How could I be fool enough to let such good love die?
Over
Why can't we just start all over
I can't believe that we could be too far gone to try

I've never known a hurt so strong
Or felt this pain before
You don't know how much I did
To have your love once more

Looking back at all I love
I see the fool I've been
Darling, why can't you and I start over once again?

Over
I can't believe we're really over
How could I be fool enough to let such good love die?
Over
Why can't we just start all over
I can't believe that we could be too far gone to try
