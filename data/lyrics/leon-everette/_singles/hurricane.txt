Thirty miles out in the Gulf Stream
I can hear those South winds moan
Bridges are lookin lower
Shrimp boats hurrying home

The old man in the quarter slowly turns to me
Took another drink of whiskey
And he looks at me and said

I was born on the rain of the Ponchatrain
Beneath the Louisiana moon
Don't mind the strain of the hurricane
She come's around every June

And high black water
She's the devil's daughter
She's hard and she's cold and she's mean
Nobody's taught her
That it takes a lot of water to wash away New Orleans

A man come down from Chicago
Gonna set that levee right
He said it's got to be three feet high up
Or it won't make it through the night
The old man down in the quarter said
Don't you listen to that boy
The water be down by the morning, son
He'll be on his way back to Illinois

I was born on the rain of the Ponchatrain
Beneath the Louisiana moon
Don't mind the strain of the hurricane
She come's around every June

And high black water
She's the devil's daughter
She's hard and she's cold and she's mean
Nobody's taught her
That it takes a lot of water to wash away New Orleans
