She loved me easy
But I was shy to know
Her love would be the hardest thing I ever tried to hold
I never though she'd turn away
And then just turn me loose
And giving up easy is hard for me to do

She was so easy
So easy to love
But there was nothing easy in giving her love
I had a good thing
That I never thought I'd loose
And giving up easy is hard for me to do

The way she leaves me is so hard to forget
She never loved like anyone that I've ever met
Now all those precious memories are pulling me in two
And giving up easy is hard for me to do
And giving up easy is hard for me to do
