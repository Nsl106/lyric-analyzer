[Verse 1]
Been havin' a ball since I was a boy in Beaumont
Love that town, but I just couldn't stay
Two stepped all the way to Amarillo
Shuffled my way into Santa Fe
Just had to see the sun set out in 'Frisco
The Golden Gate is great, but it ain't home
Give me a rodeo

[Chorus]
Blame it on Texas, don't blame it on me
I am who I am and that's what I'm gonna be
You can say what you wanna say about my insanity
Blame it on Texas, don't blame it on me

[Verse 2]
Met a girl out in eastern Oklahoma
Her daddy was a Tulsa millionaire
With miles and miles of oil wells, he'd leave her
All a man could want was waitin' there
But one night while she lay sleepin' I slipped away
Like no man in his right mind would do
Call me a fool

[Chorus]
Blame it on Texas, don't blame it on me
I am who I am and that's what I'm gonna be
You can say what you wanna say about my insanity
Blame it on Texas, don't blame it on me
