[Verse 1]
I don't know how I'll get her off my mind, but give me time
And I'll think of somethin'
I can't say today that I'm alright, but by tonight
I'll think of somethin'

[Chorus]
I'll find so many things to do
That I won't have the time to think of her
And then if she's still on my mind
I'll try to drink enough to drown the hurt
And if that don't work
I'll think of somethin'

[Verse 2]
Where do I go for love that I still need, now that I'm free?
I'll think of somethin'
And if someday by accident we meet and I can't speak
Well, I'll think of somethin'

[Chorus]
If I can't say a word to her
I'll blame it on this lump that's in my throat
And standin' there what will I do
To hide my love enough that it won't show?
Oh, I don't know
But I'll think of somethin'

[Outro]
Well, I don't know
Well, I don't know how I'll get her off my mind, but give me time
And I'll thin of somethin'
