[Verse 1]
Well, early this morning it dawned on me
The kind of man she needed me to be
She made a list and laid it there beside me on the bed
Now what I should-a done keeps running through my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh I should-a done this and I should-a done that
I should-a been there then she'd-a never left
I should-a been hangin' on every word she ever had to say

[Chorus]
But it's a little too late she's a little too gone
She's a little too right I'm a little too wrong
Now would be a good time to change
But it's a little too late

[Verse 2]
Last night I came home at a quarter til three
And to my surprise she wasn't mad at me
I thought she fin'lly realized not to worry I'd be home
And then I realized this morning she was gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh I should-a done this and I should-a done that
I should-a been there then she'd-a never left
I should-a been hangin' on every word she ever had to say

[Chorus]
But it's a little too late she's a little too gone
She's a little too right I'm a little too wrong
Now would be a good time to change
But it's a little too late

[Musical interlude]

[Chorus]
But it's a little too late she's a little too gone
She's a little too right I'm a little too wrong
Now would be a good time to change
But it's a little too late

[Outro]
Right now would be the time to change
But it's a little too late
