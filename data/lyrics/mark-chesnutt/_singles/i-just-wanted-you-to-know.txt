Are you alone, can you talk to an old friend?
Right or wrong, I had to hear your voice again
Unwritten law, protocol
Says to leave the past alone

I just wanted you to know, sometimes driving home at night
I let your memory take control and you're sitting by my side
I turn up the radio and cruise down old Route 59
Girl, it's solid gold
Well, I'll let you go, I just wanted you to know

Through the vine I heard your life has turned out well
As for mine, you know it's really hard to tell
'Cause now and then what might have been
Interferes with what might be

I just wanted you to know, sometimes driving home at night
I let your memory take control and you're sitting by my side
I turn up the radio and cruise down old Route 59
Girl, it's solid gold
Well, I'll let you go, I just wanted you to know

Please don't cry, I'll say goodbye
And I won't call you anymore

But I just wanted you to know, sometimes driving home at night
I let your memory take control and you're sitting by my side
I turn up the radio and cruise down old Route 59
Girl, it's solid gold
Well, I'll let you go, I just wanted you to know
