Last night I came home again
Three sheets to the wind
And broke the promise I swore I'd never break
And it came As no surprise
To see the hurt in her eyes
Or the Bible on the table where she prayed
This time I thought for sure she was good as gone
But she just wiped the tears away and put some coffee on

I don't know why she even hangs around
After all the hell I've put her through
And the times I've let her down
She has more faith in me than I have ever found
Heaven knows how much I need her
Thank God for believers

She says "Boy I still love you"
Oh she's Stronger than the ninety proof
I sent coursing through my veins
She says "don't give up the fight
Before long you'll get it right"
I pray to God someday I'll feel the same
Sunday morning beside her in the pew
Through blood shot eyes I try to see her point of view

I don't know why she even hangs around
After all the hell I've put her through
And the times I've let her down
She has more faith in me than I have ever found
Heaven knows how much I need her
Thank God for believers
