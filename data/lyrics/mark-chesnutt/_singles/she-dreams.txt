Thirty years today
She's been upon this earth
And she can't help but wonder what its all been worth
She swears she loves those kids
And she doesn't mind at all
But there ain't much conversation with a three year old

She's trapped inside these walls
A prisnor in this fine surburban home

So she dreams, she dreams
He'll come home from work and carry her away
And he'll see, that she needs
The man she's still in love with when she dreams

And he's proud of his work
And the ladder that he climbed
But from that high rise office he can't hear her cry
Ringin telephones
And decisions to be made
And even when he gets home he's so far away

Then he drifts off to sleep
And she enters her world of make believe

And she dreams, she dreams
He'll come home from work and carry her away
And he'll see, Oh she needs
The man she's still in love with when she dreams
