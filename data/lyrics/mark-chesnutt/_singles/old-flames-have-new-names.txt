[Verse 1]
I left town two years ago
And moved on up to Idaho
But swore that I'd be back again
Pick up where I left off on that
Left behind some lovely ladies
Grown up sexy Texas babies
I got back in town tonight
Anticipating much delight

[Pre-Chorus]
I pulled out my black book
And called up my old lovers
Well, I got five newlyweds
And two expectant mothers

[Chorus]
All my old flames have new names
Well, there's a lot of girls in town
Who've tied the knot and settled down
I thought I'd start a fire with some of my old flames
But they've all got new names

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
My sexy little dirt road sport
Is now called Mrs. Davenport
My pretty little black-eyed Susie
Is now Mrs. Susan Van-Der-Hoosie
Rosie, who could blow my mind
Is Sister Rose on channel nine
The wildest lover of my life
Is now a federal judge's wife

[Pre-Chorus]
They don't want to recognize
This old familiar face
I'm just a bad reminder
Of their wild and woolly days

[Chorus]
All my old flames have new names
Well, there's a lot of girls in town
Who've tied the knot and settled down
I thought I'd start a fire with some of my old flames
But they've all got new names

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
All my old flames have new names
Well, there's a lot of girls in town
Who've tied the knot and settled down
I thought I'd start a fire with some of my old flames
But they've all got new names
