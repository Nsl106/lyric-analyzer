[Verse 1]
Storm clouds rising, flash of lightning
Rattles that ole porch swing
Window open, curtains dancing
Just you and me
As the thunder rolls on, we'll just hold on
'Neath the light of this candle flame
Oh, this is perfect, what a night
Let it rain

[Chorus]
Let your love pour down all around
Let it fill my heart, let it flood this house
Let the world outside just wash on by
We'll just lay right here and hold on tight
Let it rain
Let it rain

[Verse 2]
Old man weather had it together
When he planned this night
From out of the blue, he set the mood
Turned out the lights
Just when we thought the storm was over
Here it comes again
So, lay back down in these arms
Let it rain

[Chorus]
Let your love pour down all around
Let it fill my heart, let it flood this house
Let the world outside just wash on by
We'll just lay right here and hold on tight
Let it rain
Let it rain
