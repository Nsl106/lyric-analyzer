Go ahead with what your doin'
You don't have to pay me any mind
Don't think I won't get to it
I got plans for her tonight

You can watch her dance forever
But you won't hold her in your arms tonight
When it's all said and done
I will be the one to hold her tight

CHORUS
So let her shine, shine, shine
Step back and let that little girl shine, shine, shine
When the night is over she'll be mine, mine, mine
Step back and let that little girl shine

She's like a brand new penny
To a boy who's never had a dime
See her sparkle, see her glisten
No one holds a candle when she shines

She turns a mile a minute
See her twirl just like a spinnin' top
But one thing that you'll find
It's me who's on her mind when the music stops

Chorus

You can watch her dance forever
But you won't hold her in your arms tonight
When it's all said and done
I will be the one to hold her tight

Chorus

Yeah yeah, let her shine
Step back and let that little girl shine
Step back and let that little girl shine shine shine
When the night is over she'll be mine mine mine
Step back and let that little girl shine
