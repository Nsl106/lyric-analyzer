[Verse 1]
I just got tired of that same old job
Tired of fighting that freeway mob
I bet you never thought I'd really go
I'd never get as far as Mexico
I've even learned to speak the language some
Down on the beach, drinking coke and rum
You wouldn't know me with this golden glow
Soaking sun in Mexico

[Chorus]
I'm eating right and I'm living good
Doing everything I said I would
I should have left a long time ago
Who needs you?
I got Mexico

[Verse 2]
Through it all, nothing's really changed
No matter what and honey, that's a shame
I still love you, that's the way it goes
He's got you, I've got Mexico

[Chorus]
But I'm eating right and I'm living good
Doing everything I said I would
I should have left a long time ago
Who needs you? I got Mexico
I'm eating right and I'm living good
Doing everything I said I would
I should have left a long time ago
He's got you, I've got Mexico

[Outro]
I'm eating right and I'm living good
Doing everything I said I would
I should have left a long time ago
