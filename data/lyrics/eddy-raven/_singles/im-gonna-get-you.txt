Hope you like the way I talk
The way I smile, the way I walk
Hope you're in to how I dress
The way I think and all the rest

'Cause, I'm gonna get you
You're gonna love me
No doubt about it
I'm gonna get you

When you're driftin' off to sleep
Close your eyes and think of me
Make it easy on yourself
Don't dream about nobody else

'Cause, I'm gonna get you
You're gonna love me
No doubt about it
I'm gonna get you

You can run and you can hide
But in the end you'll realize
You've been runnin' right to me
Turn around and there I'll be

I'm gonna get you
You're gonna love me
No doubt about it
I'm gonna get you

It ain't a matter of chance
Honey, it's destiny
There ain't no gettin' away
It's just the way it's gonna be

I'm gonna get you
You're gonna love me
No doubt about it
I'm gonna get you
