[Verse 1]
I check my pulse and my heart's still beatin'
Exhale I think I'm still breathin'
Both feet on the ground, but something's changed
I've been playin' less Black Keys, baby
And my friends swear I've gone crazy
I don't know how to act, I don't know what to say

[Chorus]
'Cause, oh, my God, he walked in
Like a 6'2'' dream Heaven sent
He says what he means, and he means what he says
And he's funny and he's smart
And he's good in — (Good in — )
Maybe love ain't always what it was
Not cryin' and dyin', and messin' me up
I think I'm really happy, I think I wanna stay
Oh, my God, am I okay?

[Verse 2]
Who knew guys still brought flowers
Or picked up the phonе before a last call hour?
And not 'cause thеy cheated, and not 'cause they lied
And not 'cause they're sorta sorry after a fight
And wait, there's guys that can communicate
That aren't lookin' for a heart to break
Always thought hell no, no way

[Chorus]
And then, oh, my God, he walked in
Like a 6'2'' dream Heaven sent
He says what he means, and he means what he says
And he's funny and he's smart
And he's good in — (Good in — )
Maybe love ain't always what it was
Not cryin' and dyin', and messin' me up
I think I'm really happy, I think I wanna stay
Oh, my God, am I okay?

[Bridge]
I don't feel like a sad song soundtrack
The old me doesn't know how to feel about that
Am I okay? I think I'm okay

[Chorus]
'Cause, oh, my God, he walked in
Like a 6'2'' dream Heaven sent
He says what he means, and he means what he says
And he's funny and he's smart
And he's good in — (Good in — )
Maybe love ain't always what it was
Not cryin' and dyin', and messin' me up
I think I'm really happy, I think I wanna stay
Oh, my God, am I okay?

[Outro]
I check my pulse and my heart's still beatin'
Exhale I think I'm still breathin'
