[Verse 1]
I'm two months deep in therapy
Been finally gettin' sleep
My friends quit checkin' up on me
'Cause I'm back on my feet
I'm doin' more than gettin' by
I've been seeing a stand-up guy
It's the middle of the night
And my phone starts ringin', and

[Chorus]
Here you come again, and there you go
No coincidence, you always know
When I'm movin' on, you move back in
With a half-ass, "Sorry, how you been?"
Why do you do it? Do you, just hate losin'?
Here you come again, who could it be?
It's 3 a.m., no caller ID

[Verse 2]
I don't need to see your name
Who else would drunk-call me this late?
Surprise, surprise, you haven't changed
I'm sure, you're sure I'll pick up
And I shouldn't want to, but I do
You know me too well, damn you
Why do I want to? I shouldn't want to

[Chorus]
Hеre you come again, and therе you go
No coincidence, you always know
When I'm movin' on, you move back in
With a half-ass, "Sorry, how you been?"
Why do you do it? Do you, just hate losin'?
Here you come again, who could it be?
It's 3 a.m., no caller ID

[Bridge]
Don't you get tired of hurtin' me?
I'm tired of hurtin' me
I'm tired of hurtin' me
So I let it ring, I let it ring

[Chorus]
Here you come again, and there you go
No coincidence, you always know
When I'm movin' on, you move back in
Keep your half-ass, "Sorry, how you been?"
I know why you do it, you just hate losin'
Here you come again, who could it be?
It's just you, no caller ID

[Outro]
It's just you, no caller ID
It's just you, no caller ID
