[Verse 1]
Let me set you the scene
November, circa 2019
Put a hole in my heart, watched it bleed
You said that we were better off as strangers
I was barely alive
Out of six feet deep, I was five
Pretty sure they called a hearse outside, okay, that's dramatic
But I survived, then I survived

[Chorus]
The "Hey Meg, I think I want you back
I'm a couple drinks in, thinkin' it's my bad
That I let you walk away and let you go" (Go)
It's a tale as old as time, I guess
When you couldn't care more, I couldn't care less
You're a little too late to the party (Little too, little too late), heartbreaker
What doesn't kill you calls you six months later

[Verse 2]
Oh, how the turns have tabled
All the sudden, now you're willing and able
Little therapy, now you're so stable
Okay, well
Your next girlfriend will be so lucky
To not hear

[Chorus]
"Hey Meg, I think I want you back
I'm a couple drinks in, thinkin' it's my bad
That I let you walk away (Let you walk away) and let you go" (Go)
It's a tale as old as time, I guess
When you couldn't care more, I couldn't care less
You're a little too late to the party (Little too, little too late), heartbreaker
What doesn't kill you calls you six months later

[Bridge]
What doesn't kill you
Makes you stronger and blonder and hotter
Makes you wonder what you even saw in him at all
What doesn't kill you always calls
(Oh, sorry, I think you have the wrong number?)

[Chorus]
With a "Hey Meg, I think I want you back (I think I want you back)
I'm a couple drinks in thinkin' it's my bad (Thinkin' it's my bad)
That I let you walk away (Let you walk away) and let you go" (Go)
It's a tale as old as time, I guess (It's old as time)
When you couldn't care more, I couldn't care less
You're a little too late to the party (Little too, little too late), heartbreaker
What doesn't kill you calls you six months later
