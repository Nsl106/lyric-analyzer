[Verse 1]
I bet one of his friends let my name slip again
And it sent you down the rabbit hole spinnin'
Now you know I sing, know my sign, know my drink
Size me up in a matter of minutes
Did you mean to double-tap that spring break throwback
From 2016 in PCB?

[Chorus]
Somewhere out there my ex-boyfriend's
New girlfriend's scrollin' through my Instagram
Tearin' me down, passin' the phone around
Like there's nothin' better to talk about
Zoomin' out, zoomin' in, overanalyzin'
Like the queen of the mean girls committee
But hey, whatever helps, keep on tellin' yourself
I'm not pretty

[Verse 2]
Girl, let me guess, you don't like how I dress
And you're hatin' on the way I talk (Bless your heart)
Give me a break, learn to sew, bake a cake
Take a walk, and while you're at it, get lost

[Chorus]
Somewhere out there my ex-boyfriend's
New girlfriend's scrollin' through my Instagram
Tearin' me down, passin' the phone around
Like there's nothin' better to talk about
Zoomin' out, zoomin' in, overanalyzin'
Like the queen of the mean girls committee
But hey, whatever helps, keep on tellin' yourself
I'm not pretty

[Bridge]
I'm not pretty, I'm not cool
I'm just one of those girls that peaked in high school
(Yeah, right)

[Chorus]
Somewhere out there my ex-boyfriend's
New girlfriend's scrollin' through my Instagram
Tearin' me down, passin' the phone around
Like there's nothin' better to talk about
Zoomin' out, zoomin' in, overanalyzin'
Like the queen of the mean girls committee
But hey, whatever helps, keep on tellin' yourself
I'm not pretty

[Outro]
I'm not pretty
Yeah, right
