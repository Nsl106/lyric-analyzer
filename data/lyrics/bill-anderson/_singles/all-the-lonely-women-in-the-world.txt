[Chorus]
This song's for all the lonely women in the world
Drivin' a car sittin' in a bar wherever you are
This song's for all the lonely women in the world
Ringin' your hands thinkin' no man understands

[Verse 1]
To me there's nothin' sadder than to see a lonely woman
Neglected by the one she loves so much
Chances are she works all day and then goes home tonight
And sits all night just longin' for his touch

[Verse 2]
Yet I've known girls with husbands in the house and still they're lonely
They've lost him to the TV and the beer
I guess somehow my heart goes out to all the lonely women
In love with all the men who just don't care

[Chorus]
This song's for all the lonely women in the world
Sittin' at home watchin' the phone on and on
This song's for all the lonely women in the world
Ringin' your hands thinkin' no man understands
