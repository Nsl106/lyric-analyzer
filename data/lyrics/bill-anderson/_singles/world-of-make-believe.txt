I make believe I make believe that you're here with me yes I do
I make believe I make believe that you'll always be my very own yes I do
I guess I'm all wrapped up in a world of make believe
I make believe I make believe every time the phone rings that it's you yes I do
I make believe every time that there's a knock on the door
I make believe it's you yes I do baby
I guess I'm all wrapped up in a world of make believe
And yet faith can move mountains and behind even the darkest cloud the sun can shine
(If you'll make believe) if you'll just make believe
Then I'll be there with you and all of our dreams will come true
And we'll both live in a world of make believe
