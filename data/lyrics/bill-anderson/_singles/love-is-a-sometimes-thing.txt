Love is a sometimes thing your love is a sometimes thing
It comes and goes like winter and spring yes your love is a sometimes thing

You told me you would always care in time of need you'd always be there
But lately I've seen so little of you makes me wonder what you been up to

Love is a sometimes thing your love is a sometimes thing
It comes and goes like winter and spring yes your love is a sometimes thing

Love is a sometimes thing your love is a sometimes thing
It comes and goes like winter and spring yes your love is a sometimes thing
