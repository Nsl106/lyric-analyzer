We couldn't call it love 'cause it really wasn't love anymore
Yet we couldn't call it hate 'cause there's no way to hate
Someone you've loved so much before
We couldn't call it livin' 'cause it wasn't still alive
We couldn't call it dead 'cause it refused to die
We ran out of anything to call it so we called it quits

Quits, quits, we called it quits
It sounds like the easy way out but oh, when it hits
The longer you live with someone you can't live with
The harder it gets
We called it magic then we called it tragic
Finally we called it quits

It's always been harder to fall out of love than fall in
I don't know where I'm goin'
But I doubt if I'll ever forget where I've been
We couldn't call it happy though it was for a while
We couldn't call it sad 'cause it taught us both to smile
For luck, for a better word to call it, we called it quits

Quits, quits, we called it quits
It sounds like the easy way out but oh, when it hits
The longer you live with someone you can't live with
The harder it gets
We called it lovely then we called it lonely
Finally we called it quits

We called it magic then we called it tragic
Finally we called it quits...
