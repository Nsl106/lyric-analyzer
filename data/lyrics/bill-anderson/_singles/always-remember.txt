[Chorus]
Always remember I love you
I love you only you
Always remember your whole life through
I love you just you

[Verse 1]
I'd give anything in this world if I could be with you right now
And hold you real tight in my arms
But since I can't I thought maybe if you knew how much I missed you
It might help you feel peaceful and warm

[Chorus]
Always remember I love you
I love you just you
Always remember your whole life through
I love you just you

[Verse 2]
And I ever thought I won't be there to lay down beside you tonight
It's not because I don't care
Darling you're in every thought that I think
Every dream and every prayer

[Outro]
So always remember I love you
I love you just you
