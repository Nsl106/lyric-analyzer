[Verse 1]
I can't see you
But I can feel
Like a scar that
Just won't heal

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Blue-eyed gypsy
You're still with me

[Chorus 1]
Everywhere I go
Lonely won't leave me alone
You're everywhere I go
Lonely won't leave me alone

[Verse 2]
Another highway
One more town
I tried to lose you
But you tracked me down

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Like the moonlight
On a dark night

[Chorus 2]
Down every winding road
Lonely won't leave me alone
Down every winding road
Lonely won't leave me alone

[Bridge]
I know you told me our love's dead and gone
But here in my heart it lives on and on

[Pre-Chorus 3]
You're every sad song
All night long

[Chorus 3/Outro]
On my radio
Lonely won't leave me alone
Lonely won't leave me alone
Lonely won't leave me alone
