[Verse 1]
Well boys I hate to leave good company
But my baby just called me on the phone
From the sound of her voice
I simply have no choice
I left somethin' turned on at home

[Verse 2]
Well I just put a quarter in the jukebox
And it ain't halfway through my favorite song
But if I don't leave right now
My whole place might burn down
'Cause I left somethin' turned on at home

[Chorus]
It ain't the stove, it ain't the heater
She's hotter and a whole lot sweeter
And all day long she's been there alone
Right now her arms are open
The house is probably smokin'
'Cause I left somethin' turned on at home

[Verse 3]
Hey waitress could you cancel that order
But if it's too late I'll take it to go
Boys I gotta run, 'fore somebody calls 911
'Cause I left somethin' turned on at home

[Chorus]
It ain't the stove, it ain't the heater
She's hotter and a whole lot sweeter
And all day long she's been there alone
Right now her arms are open
The house is probably smokin'
'Cause I left somethin' turned on at home

[Outro]
Right now her arms are open
The house is probably smokin'
'Cause I left somethin' turned on at home
Yeah I left somethin' turned on at home
