Some of us are takers
Some of us are givers
And darling, I know you're the giving kind

You'd give away the world, Lord just for the asking
But that's the way you are, so I don't mind

Now I'm not one for taking
And I'm no good at asking
But there's one thing that I've just got to say
I only want to love you
So all I'm asking of you
Is the part of you
You never gave away

Give you help to your mother
Your advice to your brother
Your money to some beggar on the street
Give your clothes to your sister
Your respect to your daddy
Give your soul to Jesus
But save your heart for me

Well the people all around you
Have grown used to leaning on you
You've always been there when someone calls
But I want more than your kindness
The part of you I want is
The part of you that matters most of all

Give you help to your mother
Your advice to your brother
Your money to some beggar on the street
Give your clothes to your sister
Your respect to your daddy
Give your soul to Jesus
But save your heart for me

Give you help to your mother
Your advice to your brother
Your money to some beggar on the street
Give your clothes to your sister
Your respect to your daddy
Give your soul to Jesus
But save your heart for me
