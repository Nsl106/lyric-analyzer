[Verse 1]
Everyday now I hear people say
My ship is sailin', could be any day
Any day now it might not feel so blue
My baby tells me, "Stop and look around
If you ain't careful, honey, trouble bound
Run home for cover and you might not find none there"

[Chorus]
He said, "There ain't no money in this runnin' around
Can't make money stayin' at home
And there ain't no future in the way that it feels today
Baby, there ain't no money
Baby, there ain't no money
Baby, there ain't no money in the ones that you really love"

[Verse 2]
I try and tell 'em, baby, straight and true
No love, no money tells you what to do
You're born to ramble, baby, that's what I was too
Just breaking even, even if I lose
Old lucky seven put his hold on you
I got your number, baby, any way you move

[Chorus]
Baby, there ain't no money and that's for sure
Ain't no money behind no doors
There ain't no trouble that a poor boy won't go through
Baby, there ain't no money
Baby, there ain't no money
Baby, there ain't no money in the ones that you really love, really love
Baby, there ain't no money in the ones that you really love

[Outro]
No running around
Just staying at home
