[Verse 1]
I'm worried about you, I'm worried about me
The curves around midnight aren't easy to see
Flashing red warnings unseen in the rain
This thing has turned into a runaway train

[Verse 2]
Long distance phone calls, a voice on the line
Electrical miles that soften the time
The dynamite too is hooked on the wire
And so are the rails of American Flyers

[Verse 3]
Blind boys and gamblers, they invented the blues
We'll pay up in blood when this marker comes due
To try and get off now, it's about as insane
As those who wave lanterns at runaway trains

[Bridge]
Steel rails and hard lives are always in twos
I have been here before this and now it's with you

[Verse] 4
I'm worried about you, I'm worried about me
We're lighting the fuses and counting to three
And what are the choices for those who remain?
The sign of the cross on a runaway train

[Outro]
This thing has turned into a runaway train
This thing has turned into a runaway train
Our love has turned into a runaway train
