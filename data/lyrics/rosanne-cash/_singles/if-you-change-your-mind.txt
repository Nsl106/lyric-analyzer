[Verse 1]
If you change your mind and leave the past behind
You know where you'll always find me
And if she breaks your heart and tears your world apart
You can always count on me
And when your heart's in doubt  and things aren't working out
I can be the one who makes you happy
Call me on the telephone, darling, I am always home
If you ever change your mind

[Verse 2]
When the time is right, I can hold you tight
You know I can wait forever
And time is on our side and we can surely find
All the love we'll ever need
Take a chance on this, seal it with a kiss
I can be the one who makes you happy
Call me on the telephone, darling, I am always home
If you ever change your mind

[Bridge]
All I have is love to give you
Baby, I could be there with you
If you ever change your mind

[Outro]
Call me on the telephone, darling, I am always home
If you ever change your mind
