[Verse 1]
I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here, so I will disappear
If he turns up while I'm gone please let me know

[Verse 2]
I had a drink or two and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if he's not there
I wonder what went wrong, I waited for too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for him

[Chorus]
Though tonight he's made me sad
I still love him
If I find him I'll be glad
I still love him

[Verse 3]
I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear
If he turns up while I'm gone please let me know

[Chorus]
Though tonight he's made me sad
I still love him
If I find him I'll be glad
I still love him

[Verse 4]
I had a drink or two and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if he's not there
I wonder what went wrong, I waited for too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for him
I think I'll take a walk and look for him
I think I'll take a walk
