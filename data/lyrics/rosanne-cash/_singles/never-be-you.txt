Take a look at my eyes
It's been a long, long time
I used to feel so strong
When I knew you were mine

But since you let me down
I'm hard to be around
I don't know what I'm gonna do
He could never be you
He could never be you

I guess it all comes around
Baby, please don't cry
Love is gonna be a little reckless
Oh, lovers all have to stand trial

Since you let me go
There's nothing going on
I don't know what I'm gonna do
He could never be you
He could never be you
Uh-uh, uh-uh, huh
He could never be you

He knows the rules
And he plays the part
But he only has me
He don't have my heart

He could never be you

So take a look at my eyes
No, you can't hide the truth
No, you don't get by on pride
It'll run over you

Since you let me down
I'm hard to be around
I don't know what I'm gonna do
He could never be you
He could never be you
Uh-uh, uh-uh, huh
He could never be you
Uh-uh, uh-uh, huh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, huh
He could never be you
Uh-uh, uh-uh, huh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, huh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, huh
He could never be you
