[Verse 1]
Just one more kiss, she'll have to miss this night with you
Now you're guilty of this secret love, as I am too
You'll get used to telling lies, feeling sorry when she cries
Now that the strings aren't attached, you'll catch on, we've done our part
Oh, and this is the way we make a broken heart

[Verse 2]
Lesson number one, we've just begun to hurt her so
And with lesson two she'll long for you when lights are low
And we get to lesson three when she gets down on her knees
And begs you to stop at the door just before she comes apart
Oh, this is the way we make a broken heart

[Bridge]
Now we've laid a trail of tears for her to follow
And we've thought of every line that she might swallow

[Verse 3]
And with lesson four, there'll be no more for her to bear
And on some dark night, we'll dim the lights on this affair
Then she'll find somebody new and he'll likely hurt her too
'Cause there must be millions just like you and me, practiced in the art
Oh, and this is the way we make a broken heart

[Outro]
Oh, and this is the way we make a broken heart
Ay yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi
This is the way we make a broken heart
Ay yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi
This is the way, this is the way, this is the way, this is the way
Oh, this is the way we make a broken heart
(This is the way, ooh)
This is the way, this is the way, this is the way, this is the way
