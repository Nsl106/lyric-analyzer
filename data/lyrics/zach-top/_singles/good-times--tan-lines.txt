[Verse 1]
Little bit of dust, little bit of smoke
Follerin’ a Chevy down a gravel road
Headin’ to a spot, everybody knows
Cannonball swingin’ from an old freight rope
Talkin’ bout—

[Chorus]
Good times and tan lines
Cold beer and summer nights
That was all there was to life
Good times and tan lines
Good, good times and tan lines

[Verse 2]
FM on, coolers on the ground
Dig through the ice and pass ‘em around
Waitin’ on the hot sun to go down
Little skinny dippin’ when the moon comes out
That sounds like—

[Chorus]
Good times and tan lines
Cold beer and summer nights
That was all there was to life
Good times and tan lines
Good, good times and tan lines

[Bridge]
Nothin’ but timе
Nothin’ to lose
Guess therе really wasn’t nothing else to do
But load up the truck and just take off
Back then buddy we had ‘em all
I’m takin’ about—

[Chorus]
Good times and tan lines
Cold beer and summer nights
That was all there was to life
Good times and tan lines
Good, good times and tan lines

[Outro]
Good times and tan lines
Good, good times and tan lines
Hmm, mmm, doo doo do a do do
