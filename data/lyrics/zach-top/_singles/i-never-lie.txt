[Verse 1]
Well, it's been some time
You still look like an angel
I heard you're doin' fine
Got promoted back in April
And you met someone, your dad says he's okay
Well, I've never been better, things are going my way

[Chorus]
I sleep like a baby, I never show up late for work
I don't drink whiskey, I don't know how it feels to hurt
Oh, and I ain't been lonely since you said goodbye
I wish I could say I miss you, but you know I never lie

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I met somebody too
She's a model out in L.A
And she's begging me to move
She says Malibu is really great
Ain't decided if I'm going or not, but at the end of the day

[Chorus]
I sleep like a baby, I never show up late for work
I don't drink whiskey, I don't know how it feels to hurt
Oh, and I ain't been lonely since you said goodbye
I wish I could say I miss you, but you know I never lie

[Bridge]
Yeah, I've never been better
Things are going my way

[Chorus]
I sleep like a baby, I never show up late for work
I don't drink whiskey, I don't know how it feels to hurt
Oh, and I ain't been lonely since you said goodbye
I wish I could say I miss you, but you know I never lie
