[Verse 1]
He said, "I don't know your story
I just know you look lonely
Fancy that, I'm lonely too
We both got our reasons, no reason to share 'em
Let's just dance, hold me closer to you
Maybe just for tonight"

[Chorus]
Tell me you love me
And tell me you need me
I know we both know it ain't true
And I'll whisper, "You're everything I've ever wanted"
I'll pretend if you'll pretend too
Oh, tell me you love me
And use me like I'm usin' you

[Verse 2]
She said, "Don't ask for my numbеr
And I won't ask for yours
Some things are best lеft alone
So just kiss me again like this never ends
Like there's no one waitin' at home"

[Chorus]
And tell me you love me
Tell me you need me
I know we both know it ain't true
And I'll whisper, "You're everything I've ever wanted"
I'll pretend if you'll pretend too
Oh, tell me you love me
And use me like I'm usin' you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Baby, I'll whisper, "You're everything I've ever wanted"
I'll pretend if you'll pretend too
Aw, tell me you love me
And use me like I'm usin' you
Mmm, like I'm usin' you
