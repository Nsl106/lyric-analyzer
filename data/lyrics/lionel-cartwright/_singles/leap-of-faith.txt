[Verse 1]
You want a no-risk guarantee
Before you take a chance
You wanna know how the song will end
Before you start to dance
Well I can't foretell the future
But my heart clearly sees
Your hand in mine for a long, long time
If you could just believe

[Chorus]
And take a leap of faith
Cast away your doubt
Darling come what may
We can work it out
A love that's real will always find a way
If you'll trust in me
Like I trust in you
There's no rain or fire
That we can't go through
The first step's always the hardest one to take
It's a leap of faith

[Verse 2]
I understand all your doubts and fears
Of laying your heart on the line
But aren't you afraid
Of just throwing away
A love like yours and mine
I know your heart's been broken
You've been let down before
Though the stakes are high
Give it one more try
This time you can be sure

[Chorus]
And take a leap of faith
Cast away your doubt
Darling come what may
We can work it out
A love that's real will always find a way
If you'll trust in me
Like I trust in you
There's no rain or fire
That we can't go through
The first step's always the hardest one to take
It's a leap of faith

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
If you'll trust in me
Like I trust in you
There's no rain or fire
That we can't go through
The first step's always the hardest one to take
It's a leap of faith
