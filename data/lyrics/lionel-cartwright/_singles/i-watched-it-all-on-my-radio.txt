[Verse 1]
I had a six-transistor when I was a kid
Under my pillow I kept it hid
When the lights went out and no one could see
Over the airwaves the world came to me

[Verse 2]
I'd go through the stations 'til I found a game
I knew how they played by the sounds of their names
The sluggers hit homers, those pitchers threw smoke
And I watched it all on my radio

[Chorus]
At the crack of the bat, I knew how far it'd go
And I watched it all on my radio
I watched it all on my radio

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
When the ball game was over, the wrap-up complete
I'd search through the static 'til I found a beat
The Beatles and Creedence, the Stones and the Byrds
You should have seen all the groups that I heard

[Verse 4]
And on Saturday night, when the skies were all clear
A station from Nashville sometimes would appear
The steel guitars and soft Southern twang
The stars of the Grand Ole Opry would sing

[Chorus]
And I had a seat on the very front row
And I watched it all on my radio
I watched it all on my radio

[Bridge]
And right about midnight, some preacher came on
To tell me what's right, to tell me what's wrong
And there was that test at the sound of the beep
"It was only a test", the voice would repeat
And the National Anthem would sing me to sleep

[Verse 6]
I had a six-transistor when I was a kid
Under my pillow I kept it hid
When the lights went out and no one could see
Over the airwaves the world came to me

[Chorus]
And I had a seat on the very front row
And I watched it all on my radio
I watched it all on my radio
