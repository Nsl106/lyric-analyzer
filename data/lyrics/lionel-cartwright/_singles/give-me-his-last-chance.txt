[Verse 1]
You've given him so many chances
And each time, he just let you down
Knowing you’ll always forgive and forget
Just keeps him coming around
You say that this is his last time
But I've heard you say that before
He's shown you what kind of love he can give you
But you deserve, oh, so much more

[Chorus]
Give me his last chance
And I’ll show you what true love means
He's had a hundred
But one chance is all that I need
Why bet your heart on a game that you know
You'll never be able to win
Give me his last chance
And never take chances again

[Bridge]
I know the love you've been dying to give
Is not the kind you have received
Why waste your time on someone who is blind
To the love you so desperately need

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
He'll never know what he'd been given
Until it's been taken away
Unless he's alone in the dark of the night
And he can’t see the light of the day
So before you go back, think it over
And remember how hard you have tried
How many promises has he gone through
How many times has he lied

[Chorus]
Give me his last chance
And I’ll show you what true love means
He's had a hundred
But one chance is all that I need
Why bet your heart on a game that you know
You’ll never be able to win
Give me his last chance
And never take chances again
