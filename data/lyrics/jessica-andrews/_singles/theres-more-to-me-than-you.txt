I spent years and all this time
Thinking I was better off
'Cuz you were mine
You always said
It was your way or the highway

So I'm shifting my life into drive
I'm getting out
Kissing the past good-bye
Like Toby said
"How do you like me now?"
This conversation has run dry
And I keep telling myself

Ooooooo, ooooooo, ooooooo
There's more to me than you
Ooooooo, ooooooo
Don't underestimate what I can do

Well, I'm alright
It's okay
I know I'll make it through
'Cuz there's more to me than you

I'm not saying
I'm battered and bruised
But I might as well be with the words you used
I believe in myself
That makes me stronger
Things changed
And so have I

I'm gonna make hay while the sun still shines
You can clip my wings
But I'm still gonna fly
I'm on my own and on my way
And I keep telling myself

Ooooooo, ooooooo, ooooooo
There's more to me than you
Ooooooo, ooooooo
Don't underestimate what I can do

Well, I'm alright
It's okay
I know I'll make it through
'Cuz there's more to me than you

There was always something
That meant more to you than me
And I'm just sorry
It's taking this for you to see

Ooooooo, ooooooo, ooooooo
There's more to me than you
Ooooooo, ooooooo
Don't underestimate what I can do

Well, I'm alright
It's okay
I know I'll make it through
'Cuz there's more to me than you

Ooooooooo, ooooooo, oooooo
There's more to me than you

There's more to me than you
