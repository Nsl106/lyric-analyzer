Indian Lake is a scene you should make with your little one
Keep it in mind if you're lookin' to find a place in the summer sun
Swim in the cove have a snack in the grove or you can rent a canoe
At Indian Lake you'll be able to make it like the Indians do
You take a bus marked Lakewood Drive
And you keep on ridin' till you're out of the city
Where the air is fine with the sweet smellin' pine
And the country side's pretty
And you'll see daffodils peepin' over the hills
Or a honey lovin' mama bear
Just take a left at the bridge go down to Quaker town Ridge
And in a minute you're there
Indian Lake is a scene you should make with your little one...
