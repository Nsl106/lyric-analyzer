[Verse 1: Riley Green]
I've been doin' better
I hardly ever think of you, lately
It ain't all sunshine
When you cross my mind
I start missin' you like crazy
I try to numb the pain
But there ain't no damn way
I end up in that place and I'm just one whiskey away

[Chorus: Riley Green]
And I don't mind if I do
Drink up the nerve to show up at your house
If you wanna know the truth
It's killin' me not holdin' you right now
I'm one memory away from fallin' all the way apart
'Cause I might still love you
Hope you don't mind if I do

[Verse 2: Riley Green & Ella Langley]
I almost quit drinkin'
For a while I quit thinkin' about you
I got a little sleep, and some nights I can't control it
And sometimes I give in because not havin' you is hard on me
And when I give into that vice and pour another over ice
Girl, I know that's when I start missin' you again

[Chorus: Riley Green & Ella Langley]
And I don't mind if I do
Drink up the nerve and show up at your house
If you wanna know the truth
It's killin' me not holdin' you right now
I'm one memory away from fallin' all the way apart
'Cause I might still love you
Hope you don't mind if I do

[Bridge: Riley Green & Ella Langley]
Need you to pick me up when I'm covered in that goodbye dust you're the only thing to get me through

[Chorus: Ella Langley & Riley Green]
Well, I don't mind if you do
Drink a little too much and show up at my house
Be nice to hear the truth
Is it killin' you not holdin' me right now?
If fallin' into me is the only thing you think is gonna get you through
Then I don't mind if you do
I don't mind
