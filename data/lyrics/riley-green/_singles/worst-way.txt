[Verse 1]
Tonight, I ain't bringin' no wine
Tonight, I ain't bringin' no roses
Talkin' would take too much time
I think I just better show you
Just turn the lights down, let's get right down to it
Soon as I walk in the door
I don't wanna be out of line
But, girl, I can't wait anymore

[Chorus]
I want you in the worst way
My hands are needin' your hips
Want the first taste
Of whiskey to be off your lips
So close all the blinds, lock all the doors
Put away anything that'll break
Baby, I need you tonight
Let's see how much love we can make
I want you in the worst way

[Verse 2]
Baby, that don't mean that I
Don't love to go wine and dine you
That ain't on the menu tonight
'Cause I think I need to remind you
That your skin on my skin
Feels just like heaven to me
You look like an angel tonight
But you might wanna slip off those wings

[Chorus]
I want you in the worst way
My hands are needin' your hips
Want the first taste
Of whiskey right off of your lips
So close all the blinds, lock all the doors
Put away anything that'll break
Baby, I need you tonight
Let's see how much love we can make
I want you in the worst way
I want you in the worst way

[Chorus]
I want you in the worst way
My hands are needin' your hips
Want the first taste
To be whiskey right off of your lips
So close all the blinds, lock all the doors
Put away anything that'll break
Baby, I need you tonight
Let's see how much love we can make
I want you in the worst way
I want you in the worst way

[Outro]
The worst way
