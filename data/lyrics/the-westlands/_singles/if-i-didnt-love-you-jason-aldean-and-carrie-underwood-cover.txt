[Verse 1: Ste Nunn]
I wouldn't mind bein' alone
I wouldn't keep checkin' my phone
Wouldn't take the long way home
Just to drive myself crazy
I wouldn't be losin' sleep
Rememberin' everything
Everything you said to me
Like I'm doin' lately

[Pre-Chorus: Both, Ste Nunn]
You, you wouldn't be all
All that I want
Baby, I could let go

[Chorus: Both]
If I didn't love you I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely gettin' by somehow
Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the want you off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you

[Verse 2: Emma Norman]
I wouldn't still cry sometimes
Wouldn't have to fake a smile
Play it off and tell a lie
When somebody asked how I've been
I'd try to find someone new
It should be somethin' I can do
Baby, if it weren't for you
I wouldn't be in the state that I'm in

[Pre-Chorus: Both, Emma Norman]
You wouldn't be all
All that I want
Baby, I could let go

[Chorus: Both, Ste Nunn, Emma Norman]
If I didn't love you I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely gettin' by somehow
Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the want you off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you (Oh, if I didn't love you)

[Bridge: Both, Ste Nunn, Emma Norman]
It wouldn't be so hard to see you
Know how much I need you
Wouldn't hate that I still feel like I do
If I didn't love you (Oh, if I didn't love you)
If I didn't love you

[Chorus: Both, Ste Nunn, Emma Norman]
If I didn't love you I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely gettin' by somehow
Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the want you off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you (Oh, if I didn't love you)
If I didn't love you (Ohhhhhh)
If I didn't love you
