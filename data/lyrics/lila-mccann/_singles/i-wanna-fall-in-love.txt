[Verse 1]
Look at me now
Won't you listen to my heart
Crying out loud
I've been standing in the dark

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I want someone to show me the way
I'm lost on a lonely road
There must be a light
At the end of the tunnel
Before I go out of control

[Chorus]
I wanna fall in love, I wanna feel that rush
Running into my heart, shaking up my soul
Feeling like I never felt before
I wanna fall in love, I wanna feel that touch
I've only dreamed about it
I been living without it
And that ain't good enough
I wanna fall in love

[Verse 2]
Somewhere out there
Someone else is searching like me
And I know he must be hurting

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Maybe tonight, he's walking down
The same road I been taking
And we'll meet up without even talking
And he'll know what I'm saying

[Chorus]
I wanna fall in love, I wanna feel that rush
Running into my heart, shaking up my soul
Feeling like I never felt before
I wanna fall in love, I wanna feel that touch
I've only dreamed about it
I been living without it
And that ain't good enough
I wanna fall in love

[Bridge]
Maybe tonight he's walking down
The same road I been taking
And we'll meet up without even talking
And he'll know what I'm saying
I wanna fall

[Chorus]
I wanna fall in love, I wanna feel that rush
Running into my heart, shaking up my soul
Feeling like I never felt before
I wanna fall in love, I wanna feel that touch
I've only dreamed about it
I been living without it
And that ain't good enough
I wanna fall in love

[Outro]
I wanna fall in love
I wanna feel that touch
Oh, I wanna fall in love
I wanna feel that rush
