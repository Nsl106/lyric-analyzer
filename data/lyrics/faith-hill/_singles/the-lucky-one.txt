[Verse 1]
So hot outside, all I can wear Is these cut off overalls
And sandals on my feet
But I emptied my pockets for a bus ticket
Just so I could sit there on a broken seat

[Refrain]
I got no place I should go, I got no worries, you know
Second or seventh street, it doesn't matter to me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're mine, that's all I need to know
The sunshine's everywhere we go
It's so right 'cause I've got you to hold
Every night, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm the lucky one
I'm the lucky one

[Verse 2]
Well, I pulled back down to my up street apartment
The air never works in that old place
Twenty-seven, I thought I'd be further along
Than just this rented space

[Refrain]
I got no papers to read, I got no cable TV, no
And I got no places to be, I got no people to meet

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're mine, that's all I need to know
The sunshine's everywhere we go
It's so right 'cause I've got you to hold
Every night, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm the lucky one
I'm the lucky one

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm the lucky one

[Bridge]
I'm on a roll when I'm with you
Don't stop me now, I just can't lose

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're mine, that's all I need to know
The sunshine's everywhere we go
It's so right 'cause I've got you to hold
Every night
'Cause you're mine, that's all I need to know
The sunshine's everywhere we go
It's so right 'cause I've got you to hold
Every night, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm the lucky one (I'm the lucky one)
I'm the lucky one (I'm the lucky one)

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm the lucky one (I'm the lucky one)
I'm the lucky one
