[Verse 1]
A little girl, a little small for her age
A little too slow for the field day race
Momma's waiting at the finish line
And wipes the teardrops from her eyes
She says, "You did just fine honey, that's okay
Sometimes life's just that way
You're gonna lose the race from time to time
But you're always gonna find

[Chorus]
"You can't lose me
Bet your life
I am here and I will always be
Just a wish away
Wherever you go
No matter how far
My love is where you are
You won't be lost if you believe
You can't lose me"

[Verse 2]
Momma used to say "Girl it won't be long
Till it's time to go out on your own
Chase your dreams find your place in life
I know you'll do just fine"
When that day finally came
There were things she needed to but could not say
So I whispered softly as I wiped the tears from momma's eyes

[Chorus]
"You can't lose me
Bet your life
I am here and I will always be
Just a wish away
Wherever you go
No matter how far
My love is where you are
You won't be lost if you believe
You can't lose me"
Wherever you go
Hey, no matter how far
My love is where you are
You won't be lost if you believe
No, you can't lose me"
Hey, hey, you can't lose me"
Wherever you go
Hey, no matter how far
My love is where you are
You can't lose me"
