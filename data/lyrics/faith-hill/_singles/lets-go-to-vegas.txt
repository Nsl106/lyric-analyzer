[Chorus]
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Kiss the single life good-bye
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Bet on love and let it ride

[Verse 1]
Lying on the bank of the river
Stars are dancin
Lord, it's hot
Holding you is what i live for
I just had a crazy thought

[Chorus]
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Kiss the single life good-bye
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Bet on love and let it ride

[Verse 2]
We'll find a little wedding chapel
A pair of rings and a preacher too
Underneath the neon steeple
We'll take a gamble and say "I do"

[Chorus]
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Kiss the single life good-bye
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Bet on love and let it ride

[Bridge]
Viva Las Vegas, sparkling lights
Dangerous living, tumbling dice
You're my ace in the hole now, honey
I'm your lady luck
Pack a few things and a little money
And put them in the truck

[Chorus]
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Kiss the single life good-bye
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Bet on love and let it ride

[Bridge]
Viva Las Vegas, sparkling lights
Dangerous living, tumbling dice
You're my ace in the hole now, honey
I'm your lady luck
Pack a few things and a little money
And put them in the truck

[Chorus]
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Kiss the single life good-bye
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Bet on love and let it ride
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Kiss the single life good-bye
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Bet on love and let it ride
Bet on love and let it ride
Bet on love and let it ride
Woo!
