[Verse 1]
They said change your clothes, she said, "No, I won't"
They said comb your hair, she said some kids don't
And her parents dreams went up in smoke
They said you can't leave, she said, "Yes, I will"
They said don't see him, she said his name is Bill
She's on a roll and it's all uphill

[Chorus]
She's a wild one with an angel's face
She's a woman-child in a state of grace
When she was three years old on her daddy's knee
He said, "You can be anything you wanna be"
She's a wild one running free

[Verse 2]
She loves rock and roll, they said it's Satan's tongue
She thinks they're too old, they think she's too young
The battle lines are clearly drawn

[Chorus]
She's a wild one with an angel's face
She's a woman-child in a state of grace
When she was three years old on her daddy's knee
He said, "You can be anything you wanna be"
She's a wild one running free

[Bridge]
She has future plans and dreams at night
When they tell her life is hard she says that's alright, yeah

[Chorus]
She's a wild one with an angel's face
She's a woman-child in a state of grace
When she was three years old on her daddy's knee
He said, "You can be anything you wanna be"
She's a wild one with an angel's face
She's a woman-child in a state of grace
When she was three years old on her daddy's knee
He said, "You can be anything you wanna be"
She's a wild one running free
