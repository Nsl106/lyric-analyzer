[Verse 1: Faith Hill]
You
Never looked so good
As you did last night
Underneath the city lights
There
Walking with your friend
Laughin' at the moon
I swear you looked right through me

[Pre-Chorus: Faith Hill]
But I'm still livin' with your goodbye
And you're just goin' on with your life

[Chorus: Faith Hill, Both]
How can you just walk on by
Without one tear in your eye?
Don't you have the slightest feelings left for me?
Maybe that's just your way
Of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall
Like we never loved at all

[Verse 2: Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, & Both]
You
I hear you're doin' fine
Seems like you're doin' well
As far as I can tell
Time (Time)
Is leaving us behind (Leavin' us behind)
Another week has passed
And still I haven't laughed yet

[Pre-Chorus: Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, & Both]
So, tell me, what your secret is, baby, yeah
(I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know)
To letting go, letting go like you did, like you did

[Chorus: Faith Hill, Both]
How can you just walk on by
Without one tear in your eye?
Don't you have the slightest feelings left for me?
Maybe that's just your way
Of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall
Like we never loved at all

[Bridge: Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, & Both]
Did you forget the magic?
Oh
Did you forget the passion? (Passion)
Oh, oh
And did you ever miss me?
Ever long to kiss me?
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, baby (Oh, baby), baby

[Outro: Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, Both]
Maybe that's just your way
Of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall
Like we never loved at all (At all)
