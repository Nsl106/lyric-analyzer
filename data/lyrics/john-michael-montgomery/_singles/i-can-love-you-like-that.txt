[Verse 1]
They read you Cinderella, you hoped it would come true
That one day your Prince Charming would come rescue you
You like romantic movies, you never will forget
The way you felt when Romeo kissed Juliet

[Pre-Chorus]
All this time that you've been waiting
You don't have to wait no more

[Chorus]
I can love you like that, I would make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I will give you my heart, be all that you need
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
If you give me a chance
I can love you like that

[Verse 2]
I'd never make a promise, I don't intend to keep
So when I say forever, forever's what I mean
I'm no Casanova, but I swear this much is true
I'll be holding nothing back when it comes to you

[Pre-Chorus]
You dream of love that's everlasting
Well, baby, open up your eyes

[Chorus]
I can love you like that, I would make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I will give you my heart, be all that you need
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
If you give me a chance
I can love you like that

[Bridge]
You want tenderness (Tenderness), I've got tenderness (Tenderness)
And I see through to the heart of you
If you want a man (Want a man) who understands
You don't have to look very far

[Chorus]
I can love you, I can, I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I will give you my heart, be all that you need
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
I can love you like that, I would make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I will give you my heart, be all that you need
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
I can love you like that, I would make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I will give you my heart, be all that you need
