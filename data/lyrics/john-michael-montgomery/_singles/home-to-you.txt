[Verse 1]
I get up and battle the day
Things don't always go my way
It might rain, but that's okay
I get to come home to you
Sometimes life may get me down
I get tired of getting kicked around
I feel lost in this maddening crowd, but I get to come home to you

[Chorus]
'Cause you are my best friend
And you are where my heart is
And I know at the day's end
I get to come home to you

[Verse 2]
Hanging out in our old sweatshirts
You let me complain about a hard day's work
I don't know what I did to deserve to get to come home to you

[Chorus]
'Cause you are my best friend
And you are where my heart is
And I know at the day's end
I get to come home to you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
'Cause you are my best friend
And you are where my heart is
And I know at the day's end
I get to come home to you

[Outro]
Yes, I get to come home to you
Oh, I love coming home to you
