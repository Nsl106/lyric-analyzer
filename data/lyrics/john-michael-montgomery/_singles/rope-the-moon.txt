[Verse 1]
I don't have a lot to show for these years of hard work
If you look at what I own
Still she's always tellin' me to hold on to my dreams
Even when my hope is gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Some may say that dreaming's just for fools
And there are times I thought that might be true

[Chorus]
But she thinks I could rope the moon
In her eyes, there is nothin' I can't do
When I think it's out of reach, she's the reason I still try
She thinks I could rope the moon

[Verse 2]
When I look at the sky but can't see through the clouds
She shows me the brightest star
If I think of turnin' back 'cause I'm havin' my doubts
She tells me I've come so far

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing in this world comes easily
But I can't lose with her right next to me

[Chorus]
'Cause she thinks I could rope the moon
In her eyes, there is nothin' I can't do
When I think it's out of reach, she's the reason I still try
She thinks I could rope the moon
Oh, she thinks I could rope the moon
