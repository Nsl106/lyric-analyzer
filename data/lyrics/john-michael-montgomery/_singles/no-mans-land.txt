[Verse 1]
That house on the hill is long gone
Now she's living in a trailer with an AstroTurf lawn
Got three little kids and no one to help
Trying to be Momma and Daddy all by herself
It's hard to hold down the fort when you're holding down a job
She'd rob Peter to pay Paul, but he's already been robbed
She gets the food on the table, the clothes off the line
She'd break down and cry, but she doesn't have time

[Chorus]
She's gotta be strong, life goes on
Though it's nothing like she had planned
She's gonna be okay, gonna find a way
Living in no man's land

[Verse 2]
Every now and then, late at night
She thinks of how it would feel to hold someone tight
There's a guy down at work, he keeps calling her up
But she ain't ready for none of that stuff
She's still sifting through the ashes of a love that's been and gone
Looking for a clue, trying to find out what went wrong
It ain't always easy, but she knows she's gotta try
Every time she looks in her babies' eyes

[Chorus]
She's gotta be strong, life goes on
Though it's nothing like she had planned
She's gonna be okay, gonna find a way
Living in no man's land

[Chorus]
She's gotta be strong, life goes on
Though it's nothing like she had planned
She's gonna be okay, gonna find a way
Living in no man's land
