[Verse 1: John Michael Montgomery]
Her parents never took the young girl to church
Never spoke of His Name, never read her His Word
Two non-believers walkin' lost in this world
Took their baby with them, what a sad little girl

[Verse 2: John Michael Montgomery]
Her Daddy drank all day and Mommy did drugs
Never wanted to play, or give kisses and hugs
She'd watch the TV, and sit there on the couch
While her Mom fell asleep, and her Daddy went out

[Chorus 1: John Michael Montgomery, Alison Krauss & Dan Tyminski]
And the drinking and the fighting
Just got worse every night
Behind their couch she'd be hiding
Oh, what a sad little life

[Verse 3: John Michael Montgomery]
And like it always does, the bad just got worse
With every slap and every curse
Until her Daddy, in a drunk rage one night
Used a gun on her Mom, and then took his life

[Chorus 2: John Michael Montgomery, Alison Krauss & Dan Tyminski]
And some people from the city
Took the girl far away
To a new Mom and a new Dad
Kisses and hugs everyday

[Verse 4: John Michael Montgomery]
Her first day of Sunday school, the teacher walked in
And a small little girl stared at a picture of Him
She said, I know that man up there on that cross
I don't know His name, but I know He got off

[Chorus 3: John Michael Montgomery, Alison Krauss & Dan Tyminski]
'Cause He was there in my old house
And held me close to His side
As I hid there behind our couch
The night that my parents died
