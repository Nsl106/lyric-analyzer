[Verse 1]
You drive a baby blue Beamer, I drive a pickup truck
I'm a member of the good ol' boys, you're a member of the Country Club
You keep turning me down when I ask you out, but I ain't giving up
I'm gonna show you, darlin', a little cowboy love

[Chorus]
Let me broaden your horizons
Teach you 'bout the finer things in life
Like some late night horseback riding
Sipping on some southern homemade wine
If a little two-stepping, stargazing, breathtaking, lovemaking
Is what you're dreaming of
Then let me show you, darlin', a little cowboy love

[Verse 2]
You need a little adventure to ignite your world
I can picture you in cowboy boots, I can picture you a country girl
Once you give me a try, then you'll know why you can't get enough
So let me show you, darlin', a little cowboy love

[Chorus]
Let me broaden your horizons
Teach you 'bout the finer things in life
Like some late night horseback riding
Sipping on some southern homemade wine
If a little two-stepping, stargazing, breathtaking, lovemaking
Is what you're dreaming of
Then let me show you, darlin', a little cowboy love

[Bridge]
Underneath the midnight moonlight
Cuddled up real tight, cozy down by the fire
Listening to some George Strait, George Jones
Country love songs, you'll change your mind

[Chorus]
Well, let me broaden your horizons
Teach you 'bout the finer things in life
Like some late night horseback riding
Sipping on some southern homemade wine
If a little two-stepping, stargazing, breathtaking, lovemaking
Is what you're dreaming of
Then let me show you, darlin', a little cowboy love

[Refrain]
Let me show you, darlin', a little cowboy love
