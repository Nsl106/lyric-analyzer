I watch her lyin' in bed asleep
And I thank my lucky stars
For every second she's here with me
I wanna hold her in my arms
She is my day
She is my night
She is the breath that gives me life

Sometimes we laugh, sometimes we cry
Sometimes we fight and we don't know why
But no matter what she believes in me
She's the closest to heaven I'll ever see
She'll always be an angel in my eyes

Sometimes I feel her by my side
Like she's watchin' over me
I get a chill runnin' down my spine
And that's all the proof I need
That she fills my heart
She fills my soul
She is the half that makes me whole

Sometimes we laugh, sometimes we cry
Sometimes we fight and we don't know why
But no matter what she believes in me
She's the closest to heaven I'll ever see
She'll always be

Well sometimes we laugh, and sometimes we cry
Sometimes we fight and we dont know why
But no matter what she believes in me
She's the closest to heaven I'll ever see
She'll always be
She'll always be
She'll always be
An angel in my eyes
