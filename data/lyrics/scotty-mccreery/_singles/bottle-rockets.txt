[Verse 1: Scotty McCreery]
Everybody's got a summer that they can't forget
They hold on to and go back to
Yeah, mine's on the Carolina coast
Still burnin' in my mind like a red sunset
Chasin' embers till September
What I remember most

[Chorus: Scotty McCreery, Hootie & the Blowfish]
Bottle rockets in the sky
Bare feet in the sand
Bonfire in her eyes
Cold beer in the can
Moonlight on the waves
Her kiss in the dark
The smile on her face
When she'd make me break out my guitar and play
Hold my hand
Hold my hand

[Verse 2: Scotty McCreery]
I can still feel her fingers wrapped up in mine
Can still hear her laughin', see her dancin'
Yeah, makin' more than that sundress spin
Now, who says you can't go back in time?
Yeah, when that song, it comes on
I'm on rewind and I'm seventeen again

[Chorus: Scotty McCreery, Hootie & the Blowfish]
Bottle rockets in the sky
Bare feet in the sand
Bonfire in her eyes
Cold beer in a can
Moonlight on the waves
Her kiss in the dark
The smile on her face
When she'd make me break out my guitar and play
Hold my hand
I want you to hold my hand
Hold my hand
Oh

[Bridge: Scotty McCreery, Hootie & the Blowfish, Both]
I got a hand for you
Yeah, I got a hand for you
I wanna run with you
Won't you let me run with you? Oh

[Chorus: Scotty McCreery, Hootie & the Blowfish]
Bottle rockets in the sky
Bare feet in the sand
Bonfire in her eyes
Cold beer in a can
Moonlight on the waves
Her kiss in the dark
The smile on her face
When she'd make me break out my guitar and play
Hold my hand
I want you to hold my hand
Hold my hand
I'll take you to the promised land
Hold my hand
Maybe we can't change the world, but
I wanna love you the best that, the best that I can

[Outro: Scotty McCreery, Hootie & the Blowfish, Both]
(Hold my hand) Bottle rockets in the sky
The best that I can (Hold my hand)
Bare feet in the sand
The best that I can (Hold my hand)
Bonfire in her eyes
Oh (Hold my hand)
I wanna love you the best that, the best that I can
