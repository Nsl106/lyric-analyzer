[Intro]
You time, you time, you time
You time, you time, you time

[Verse 1]
The road's got me rollin' six days a week
Whole lotta work and not much sleep
But I love what I do
Yeah, I know it's what I signed up for
Chasin' dreams from shore to shore
And even seeing some come true

[Pre-Chorus]
But now and then
I need to stop the spinnin' of the world, yeah

[Chorus]
And I need a little you time, you time, red wine
Sippin' in the moonlight
Your touch, your skin, your lips
Kissin' on me all night
I ain't tryna monopolize
Your 24/7, 365, but sometimes I need
Just a little bit of me and you time, you time, you time
Oh

[Verse 2]
You're up before that sun can risе
Climbin' mountains, changin' lives
Baby, I love what you do
You bring a smile to еvery face
You make this world a better place
You light up every room

[Pre-Chorus]
But girl now don't you know
Sometimes I want you to myself with no one else?

[Chorus]
Yeah, you time, you time, red wine
Sippin' in the moonlight
Your touch, your skin, your lips
Kissin' on me all night
I ain't tryna monopolize
Your 24/7, 365, but sometimes I need
Just a little bit of me and you time, you time, you time
Yeah, you time, you time, you time
Yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
But now and then
I need to stop the spinnin' of the world, yeah

[Chorus]
And I need a little you time, you time, red wine
Sippin' in the moonlight
Your touch, your skin, your lips
Kissin' on me all night
I ain't tryna monopolize
Your 24/7, 365, but sometimes I need
Just a little bit of me and you time, you time, you time
Yeah, you time, you time, you time
Yeah, ayy

[Outro]
Just me and you
Just me and you, girl
