[Verse 1]
Take off your makeup, nobody's around
It's you and me, girl, just let your guard down
I see right through you, I know what it means
I know I got you, the moment when you close your eye-eye-eyes
I know I'm doing something right-ight-ight

[Chorus]
I got you down to a t-shirt, white sheets, red wine
Baby, you don't wanna leave
You want a record with some reverb, backbeat and low light
You know I know what you need tonight
Girl, I'll take my ti-ime, dot every I, I, baby, I, I
I got you down to a T
Mmm

[Verse 2]
Stay here 'til sunrise, I wanna know you
Like it's the last time I'll ever hold you
Girl, every detail leave it up to me
Lay back and let go
You don't even have to say-ay-ay anything
About the way-ay-ay

[Chorus]
You should see how you look in that t-shirt
White sheets and red wine
Baby, you don't wanna leave
You want a record with some reverb, backbeat and low light
You know I know what you need tonight
Girl, I'll take my ti-ime, dot every I, I, baby, I, I
I got you down to a T
Whoa, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Got you down, got you down (Got you down, down)
Got you down, got you down (Got you down, down)
Don't worry, baby
'Cause driving you crazy is all I ever wanted

[Chorus]
Now that I got you down to a t-shirt
White sheets and red wine, mmm
You want a record with some reverb, backbeat and low light
You know I know what you need tonight
Girl, I'll take my ti-ime, dot every I, I, baby, I, I
I got you down to a T

[Outro]
Whoa
I got you down to a t
Got you down, got you down
Got you down, got you down
I got you down to a t
