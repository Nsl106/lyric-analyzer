[Verse 1]
I thought I knew the girl so well
If she was sad I couldn't tell
I missed the point, I missed the signs
So if she's gone the fault is mine
I know, I know a whole lot of little things
Even though I could list them one by one
She would still be gone

[Chorus]
Her eyes were blue, her hair was long
In '64, she was born in Baton Rouge
Her favorite song was "In My Life"
I memorized her every move
I knew her books, her car, her clothes
But I paid no attention to what mattered most

[Verse 2]
I never asked, she never said
And when she cried I turned my head
She dreamed her dreams behind closed doors
That made them easy to ignore
And I know, I know I missed the forest for the trees
And all I have to show when she walked out the door
Are cold facts and nothing more

[Chorus]
Her eyes were blue, her hair was long
In '64, she was born in Baton Rouge
Her favorite song was "In My Life"
I memorized her every move
I knew her books, her car, her clothes
But I paid no attention to what mattered most

[Chorus]
Her eyes were blue, her hair was long
In '64, she was born in Baton Rouge
Her father's tall, her mother's gone
She moved out west when she was two
The way she laughed, the way she loved
Oh my God, what did I do
