[Verse 1]
I believe in ghosts, most people don't
I swear it on my grandpa's grave
I've seen 'em in the trees, I've seen 'em in my dreams
And I still can't stay away
My heart wants to wander here and over yonder
I let you come along and take it
And maybe you're the right one, the right by my side one
Or maybe you're the one that's gonna break it

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm fearless, I'll jump off the ledges
Burn all the bridges, walk on thе edges
I'm fearlеss, I don't mind the shadows
Take all the arrows, ride in the echoes
And I don't mind the night, I don't mind the fight even if I lose
I got thick skin, I'll dive in, I'm fearless
Except when it comes to you

[Verse 2]
So, baby, here I am in the palm of your hand
You got me where you want and you know it
You're lookin' right at me, you're holdin' all the keys
And I don't even care where we're goin'

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm fearless, I'll jump off the ledges
Burn all the bridges, walk on the edges
I'm fearless, I don't mind the shadows
Take all the arrows, ride in the echoes
And I don't mind the night, I don't mind the fight even if I lose
I got thick skin, I'll dive in, I'm fearless
Except when it comes to you

[Bridge]
I can be a loner, a dog without a home
Or wild like the wild things are
I don't scare easy as long as you keep me
Just square in the middle of your arms

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm fearless, I'll jump off the ledges
Burn all the bridges, walk on the edges
I'm fearless, I don't mind the shadows
Take all the arrows, ride in the echoes
And I don't mind the night, I don't mind the fight even if I lose
I got thick skin, I'll dive in, I'm fearless
Except when it comes to you
When it comes to you
