[Verse 1]
We were eighteen, it was prom night
And we had our first big fight
She said, "Pull this car over," I did and then I told her
"I don't know what you are cryin' for"
I grabbed her hand as she reached for the door

[Chorus]
She said, "I'll walk, let go of my hand
Right now I'm hurt and you don't understand
So just be quiet and later we will talk
Just leave, don't worry, I'll walk"

[Verse 2]
It was a dark night, a black dress
The driver never saw her around the bend
I never will forget the call or drivin' to the hospital
When they told me her legs still wouldn't move
I cried when I walked into her room

[Chorus]
She said, "I'll walk, please come and hold my hand
Right now I'm hurt and I don't understand
Let's just be quiet and later we can talk
Please stay, don't worry, I'll walk"

[Bridge]
I held her hand through everything
The weeks and months of therapy
And I held her hand and asked her to be my bride
She's dreamed from a little girl
To have her daddy bring her down the aisle
So from her wheelchair, she looks up at him and smiles

[Chorus]
And says, "I'll walk, please hold my hand
I know that this will hurt, I know you understand
Please, Daddy, don't cry, this is already hard
Let's go, don't worry
I'll walk"
