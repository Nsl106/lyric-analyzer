[Verse 1]
I got up this morning and while I was having my coffee
My woman came in and sat down by my side
With tears in her eyes, she said, "I have a confession to make"
And I said, "Woman, speak what's on your mind"

[Chorus]
She said, "I've found somebody new
To take your place"
I said, "Don't feel so all alone
I've found someone of my own"

[Verse 2]
You know those lonely nights when you left me all alone
Oh, my new love would call and comfort me on the telephone
And I said, "Darling, if that's the way it's gotta be
Oh, sweet woman, don't you worry 'bout me"

[Chorus]
She said, "I've found somebody new
To take your place"
I said, "Don't feel so all alone
I've found someone of my own"

[Verse 3]
I got up from the table, I reached down and wiped the tears from her face
I put out my cigarette, turned and walked away

[Chorus]
She said, "I've found somebody new
To take your place"
I said, "Don't feel so all alone
I've found someone of my own"
She said, "I've found somebody new
To take your place"
I said, "Don't feel so all alone
I've found someone of my own"
