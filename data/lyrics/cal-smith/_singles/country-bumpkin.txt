[Verse 1]
He walked up to the bar and parked his lanky frame upon a tall barstool
And with a long soft southern drawl, said, "I'll just have a glass of anything that's cool"
A barroom girl with hard and knowing eyes slowly looked him up and down
And she thought, "I wonder how on earth that country bumpkin found his way to town"

[Chorus 1]
She said, "Hello, country bumpkin
How's the frost down on the pumpkin?
I've seen some sights, but man, you're somethin'
Where'd you come from, country bumpkin?"

[Verse 2]
It was just a short year later in a bed of joy-filled tears, yet death-like pain
Into this wondrous world of many wonders, one more wonder came
That same woman's face was wrapped up in a raptured look of love and tenderness
As she marveled at the soft and warm and cuddly boy child feeding at her breast

[Chorus 2]
And she said, "Hello, country bumpkin
Fresh as frost out on the pumpkin
I've seen some sights, but babe, you're somethin'
Mama loves her country bumpkin"

[Verse 3]
Forty years of hard work later in a simple, quiet and peaceful country place
The heavy hand of time had not erased the raptured wonder from the woman's face
She was lying on her deathbed, knowing fully well her race was nearly run
But she softly smiled and looked into the sad eyes of her husband and her son

[Chorus 3]
And she said, "So long, country bumpkin
The frost is gone now from the pumpkin
I've seen some sights and life's been somethin'
See you later, country bumpkin"
She said, "So long, country bumpkin
The frost is gone now from the pumpkin
I've seen some sights and life's been somethin'
See you later, country bumpkin"
