I've been up and I've been down I've worked the fields I've plowed the ground
I've taken strain and pressure till I thought I might explode
Now I yearn for childhood days of model planes and lemonade
When the day stretched out before me like a long long Texas road
Yes a long long Texas road bout a million miles or so
When you're just a child there ain't no time but now
Must have left that long old road seven hundred years ago
And I'd find it once again if I knew how

I've worked in city factories their plastic dirt still clings to me
Monotory near killed me Lord it was a heavy load
Now I dream of comic books and horny toads and fishin' hooks
When the day stretched out before me like a long long Texas road
Yes a long long Texas road...

So I watch the children play and dream my dreams of yesterday
Don't tell them to be grateful I'm sure that they've been told
If I knew then what I know now that would have messed it up somehow
When the day stretched out before me like a long long Texas road
Yes a long long Texas road...
