Mother Nature's opened up the door
To lots of things I never saw before
It's a lovely, lovely world
Since I met you

Never did see everything looking so right
I just learned the meaning of paradise
It's a lovely, lovely world since I met you

Now the sun shines brighter
And the skies are a little bit bluer
And my little old rattletrap Ford Coupe
Even seems a little bit newer

And my guitar stays a little bit better in tune
The stars are brighter
There's honey on the moon
It's a lovely, lovely world since I met you

Ever since you cuddled in my embrace
I've had more faith in the human race
It's a lovely, lovely world since I met you

Now I don't mind working and slaving all day
Cause I know tonight
There'll be love to pay
It's a lovely, lovely world since I met you

Everything seems natural and right
Since the day I found you
Everything looks rosy and shiny bright
In the dreams I'm building around you

I used to think that
Miracles never come true but now
I'm happy cause I know they do
It's a lovely, lovely world since I met you
