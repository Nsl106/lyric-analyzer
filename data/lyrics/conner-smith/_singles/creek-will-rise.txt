[Verse 1]
Well, we were sittin' on the truck bed
When it started rainin', she said, "I don't mind"
Got her dancin' in a white sundress
Couldn't even find one dry thread, my oh my

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I didn't know what I was getting into
I, I wish the four-wheel drive was just two

[Chorus]
'Cause a girl like her on a night like this
Make a man wanna stay right where he is
There's trouble in the way her green eyes are glowin'
I'm holdin' on tight, prayin' and hopin'
This truck battery dies
Or the road's too muddy to drive
Wanna stay right here all night
If the good Lord's willin', that creek will risе

[Verse 2]
Next thing I know
I had my blue jeans hangin' on a tree limb
Shе was smilin' at me, pullin' me in
Out where the creek bend bends in the yellow moon light
Makin' fishin' in the dark come to life

[Chorus]
Yeah, a girl like her on a night like this
Make a man wanna stay right where he is
There's trouble in the way her green eyes are glowin'
I'm holdin' on tight, prayin' and hopin'
This truck battery dies
Or the road's too muddy to drive
Wanna stay right here all night
If the good Lord's willin', that creek will rise

[Bridge]
Well, it was four in the mornin' when the storm quit stormin'
I was fallin' faster than Earnhardt and Gordon
Like a dirt road Daytona in my heart
And we ain't even got to the best part
We didn't have a towel, didn't have dry clothes
She was smilin' and sayin', "Hold me, I'm cold"
We made a blanket out of that sundress
And the radio won't even let me tell you the rest

[Chorus]
'Cause a girl like her on a night like this
Make a man wanna stay right where he is
There's trouble in the way her green eyes are glowin'
I'm holdin' on tight, prayin' and hopin'
This truck battery dies
Or the road's too muddy to drive
Wanna stay right here all night
If the good Lord's willin', that creek will rise
Well, that creek will rise
