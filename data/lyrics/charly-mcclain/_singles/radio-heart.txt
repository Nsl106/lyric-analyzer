Married at 16
Two kids by 21
But he couldn't take it
Now she's raising them on her own

Between the bills and the laundry
Sometimes she's so lonely she cries
But she's found an escape
From some of the aching inside

She's got a radio heart
She loves the songs they play
They take him off her mind
She's got a radio heart
It helps fill an empty space he left behind

She gets lost in a steel guitar
Oh it's her way out when the heartache starts
She's found a little salvation in a local station
She's got a radio heart

She'll finish clearin' the table
And put the kids off to bed
She tries to watch an old movie
But she thinks of him instead

She lies alone in the dark
And stares at the lighted dial
She gets into the music
And out of this world for a while

She's got a radio heart
She loves the songs they play
They take him off her mind
She's got a radio heart
It helps fill an empty space he left behind

She gets lost in a steel guitar
Oh, it's her way out when the heartache starts
She's found a little salvation in a local station
She's got a radio heart
She's got a radio heart
