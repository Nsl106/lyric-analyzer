Angry words were spoken
And I left my baby in a cloud of gloom
Got into my car and drove around
Until I spotted this saloon

Came inside and bought a drink
Then I saw you and felt a burning glow
Got the urge to hold you tight
But if I try refuse me, tell me no

Step aside if I try to get near you
Lock your heart if I start making time
Walk away if I say that I need you
Step aside if I step out of line

Bitter is my feelings for my baby
And the things she said so cruel
Half of me says cheat on her
But part of me says stop don't be a fool

Don't let me get close to you
'Cause if I do I won't be very strong
Save me from my conscience
And keep me from being sorry later on

Step aside if I try to get near you
Lock your heart if I start making time
Walk away if I say that I need you
Step aside if I step out of line

Step aside if I step out of line...
