[Verse 1]
It's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me
Wishing I'd never met her, knowing if I'd forget her
How much better off she would be

[Chorus]
The longer I hold on and the longer this goes on
The harder that it's gonna be
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me

[Verse 2]
I've never deserved her, God knows when I hurt her
That's the last thing that I want to do
She tries but she can't tell how she feels
But I know too well what she's going through

[Chorus]
If I love her so much I don't know why I can't do
The right thing and just let her be
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Last night I told her this time it's all over
Making ten times I've told her goodbye
Last night we broke up, this morning I woke up
And for the tenth time, I'm changing my mind

[Chorus]
I saw more love in her eyes when I left her
Than most foolish men will ever see
And it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me

[Outro]
It's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me
Wishing I'd never met her, knowing if I'd forget her
How much better off she would be...
