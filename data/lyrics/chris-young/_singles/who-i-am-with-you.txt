[Verse 1]
I've been a rollin' stone all my life
Flyin' all alone, flyin' blind
I've seen it all, I've been around
I've been lost and I've been found

[Chorus]
But who I am with you is who I really wanna be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holdin' you
It feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah, a better man is who I am with you

[Verse 2]
I've got a ways to go on this ride
But I got a hand to hold that fits just right
You make me laugh, you make me high
You make me wanna hold on tight

[Chorus]
But who I am with you is who I really wanna be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holdin' you
It feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah, a better man is who I am with you
Who I am with you

[Bridge]
Because of you, I'm a lucky man
And you're the best part of who I am

[Chorus]
Who I am with you is who I really want to be
You're so good, you're so good for me, baby
And when I'm holdin' you it feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah, a better man is who I am with you
Yeah, it's who I am with you
