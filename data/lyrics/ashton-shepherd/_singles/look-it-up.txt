[Verse 1]
The word is “faithful” - look it up
It don't mean sneakin' around
Behind my back like a-you ain't gettin' enough
How 'bout “forever”? Just look it up
It means through thick and thin and
Pitchin' in even when the times get tough

[Verse 2]
The word is “easy” - look it up
And you'll see a picture of that piece of trash
Ridin' 'round in your pickup truck
Let's try “liar” - just look it up
But you'll need boots to wade through all the bull
You tell me when you come home drunk

[Pre-Chorus]
It's just like you to be so clueless
‘Cause you never thought I'd do this

[Chorus]
I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out, get gone
The word is “over”
Look it up

[Verse 3]
You said you're “sober” - look it up
It's right next to “hell is freezin' over, flyin' pigs,”  and all that stuff
And how ‘bout “baby”? Look it up
It's what you call me and it's how you act
Every time I call your bluff

[Pre-Chorus]
It's just like you to keep denyin'
Save your whinin' and your cryin'

[Chorus]
I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out, get gone
The word is “over”
Look it up

[Verse 4]
The word's “forgiveness” - look it up
It's what Jesus has in store for you
But I don't no matter what

[Pre-Chorus]
Quit your beggin' and the prayin'
Can't you hear what I've been sayin'?

[Chorus]
I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out, get gone
The word is “over”
Look it up

[Outro]
Asshole
Just look it up
Look it up
