[Intro]
You see that mountain over there? Yeah?
Yeah, one of these days I'm going to climb that mountain

[Chorus]
Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway

[Verse 1]
Drift away like Tom Sawyer
Ride a raft with old Huck Finn
Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle
Daze dreaming again

[Chorus]
Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway

[Verse 2]
Swim across the river
Just to prove that I'm a man
Spend the day being lazy
Just being nature's friend
Climb a long tall hickory
Bend it over, skinnin' cats
Playing baseball with chert rocks
Using sawmill slabs for bats

[Bridge]
Play some back-home, come-on music
That comes from the heart
Play something with lots of feeling
'Cause that's where music has to start

[Chorus]
Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway
Hey, hey

[Outro]
Oh, play me mountain music
Oh, play me mountain music
Oh, play me mountain music
Oh, play me mountain music
Yee-haw!
