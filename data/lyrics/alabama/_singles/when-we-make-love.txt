[Verse 1]
There's a light in your eyes tonight
You know I'd know that look anywhere
You got plans and I'm one lucky man
Before we get so carried away
There's just something I've been wantin' to say

[Chorus]
When we make love
It's more to me than just an affair
I want you to know how much I care
When we make love
Oh, it's such a precious time
We share our hearts, our souls and our minds
When we make love
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Watchin' you make your little moves
I can tell it's gonna be a long night
All day long, we keep holdin' on
It couldn't be any better than this
I got it all at my fingertips

[Chorus]
When we make love
Oh, it's more to me than just an affair
I want you to know how much I care
When we make love
Oh, it's such a precious time
We share our hearts, our souls and our minds

[Bridge]
These moments
These feelings
Mmm-mmm

[Chorus]
When we make love
It's more to me than just an affair
I want you to know how much I care
When we make love
Oh, it's such a precious time
We share our hearts, our souls and our minds

[Outro]
Oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, huh
Now let's make love
Sweet love
