[Verse 1]
I'll admit I could feel it
The first time that we touched
And the look in your eyes
Said you felt as much
But I'm not a man
Who falls too easily
It's best that you know
Where you stand with me

[Chorus]
I will give you my heart
Faithful and true
And all the love it can hold
That's all I can do
But I've thought about
How long I'll love you
And it's only fair that you know
Forever's as far as I'll go

[Verse 2]
When there's age around my eyes
And gray in your hair
And it only takes a touch
To recall the love we've shared
I won't take for granted
You know my love is true
'Cause each night in your arms
I will whisper to you

[Chorus]
I will give you my heart
Faithful and true
And all the love it can hold
That's all I can do
'Cause I've thought about
How long I'll love you
And it's only fair that you know
Forever's as far as I'll go
Forever's as far as I'll go
