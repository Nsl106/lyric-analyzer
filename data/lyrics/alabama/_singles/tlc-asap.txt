[Intro]
I need T.L.C. A.S.A.P

[Verse 1]
Well, my muscles ache and my feet are sore
Thank God it's Friday and it's almost four
And time to hit the door
I'm gonna spend the weekend on the lake
We've been working overtime and we need a break
And honey, I can't wait

[Pre-Chorus]
We know how to spell relief
Got a good old-fashioned recipe

[Chorus]
A little T.L.C. A.S.A.P
A little R&R for you and me
A guaranteed rat race remedy
A little T.L.C. A.S.A.P

[Verse 2]
Take a book to read and a change of clothes
Well, I packed the cooler and the Coleman stove
And the radio
We can hold on a raft in the sun all day
We can love in the moonlight hours away
While the crickets play

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, we work real hard six days a week
Honey, this is something we both need

[Chorus]
A little T.L.C. A.S.A.P
A little R&R for you and me
A guaranteed rat race remedy
A little T.L.C. A.S.A.P

[Chorus]
A little T.L.C. A.S.A.P
A little R&R for you and me
A guaranteed rat race remedy
A little T.L.C. A.S.A.P

[Outro]
T.L.C. A.S.A.P
R&R for you and me
T.L.C. A.S.A.P
R&R for you and me
