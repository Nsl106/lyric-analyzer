[Verse 1]
Thinkin' of the faces I've seen
Back when I was young and green
I was fallin' back then
Now I'm workin' on buildin' a fire
And flirtin' with that old desire
And fallin' again into the wind

[Chorus]
I fall in, in again
I fall in love again
I'm fallin' again

[Verse 2]
Well, you'd think that I would learn by now
To keep from fallin' somehow
But I'm fallin' again
'Cause when I caught that look in your eyes
That's when I realized
I was fallin' again into the wind

[Chorus]
I fall in, in again
I fall in love again

[Bridge]
Fall, fall, fall, fallin' again
Fall, fall, fall, fallin' again
Fall, fall, fall, fallin' again

[Chorus]
I fall in, in again
I fall in love again
Fallin' again into the wind

[Bridge]
Fall, fall, fall, fallin' again
Fall, fall, fall, fallin' again

[Chorus]
I fall in, in again
I fall in love again
Fallin' again into the wind
