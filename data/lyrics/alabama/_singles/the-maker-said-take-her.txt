I was taught to believe, and never to doubt
The man up above, knows what he's talking about
So when I heard that voice, so loud and clear
Speak to my heart I knew that she must be near

The maker said take her and love her forever
Take care of her for life
And treat her right

I never was the one for listening very well
I walked my own way and felt what I felt
Further out of touch with the master plan
She was like a flight to the promised land

And
The maker said take her and love her forever
Take care of her for life
Never forsake her, don't be a heartbreaker
The maker said take her and treat her right
Just treat her right

He placed an angel in the palm of my hands
And for once of my life I obeyed his comands

I'll take her and lover her forever
Take care of her for life
Never forsake her, don't be a heartbreaker
The maker said take her and treat her right
Just treat her right
Just treat her right

The maker said take her and love her forever;
Take care of her for life
Never forsake her, don't be no heartbreaker
The maker said take her and treat her right
And treat her right

For life
