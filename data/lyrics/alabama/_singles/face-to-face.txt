[Verse 1]
Run your fingers through my hair
And softly kiss my lips
And hold me close in your embrace
And love me face to face

[Chorus]
Face to face, heart to heart
Body to body
Tingling tangle feelings
Lovers face to face

[Verse 2]
I'll caress your body
And hold you close to me
I'll slide my hands around your waist
And love you face to face

[Chorus]
Face to face, heart to heart
Body to body
Lips on lips, arm and arm
Body to body
Tingling tangle feelings
Lovers face to face

[Verse 3: K.T. Oslin, Alabama, both]
Softly say you love me
As you make love to me
No one else can take your place
We happen face to face
