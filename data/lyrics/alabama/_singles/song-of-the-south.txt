[Chorus]
Song, Song of the South
Sweet potato pie, and I shut my mouth
Gone, Gone with the Wind
There ain't nobody lookin' back again

[Verse 1]
Cotton on the roadside, cotton in the ditch
We all picked the cotton, but we never got rich
Daddy was a veteran, a Southern Democrat
They oughta get rich man to vote like that

[Chorus]
Singin'
Song, Song of the South
Sweet potato pie, and I shut my mouth
Gone, Gone with the Wind
There ain't nobody lookin' back again

[Verse 2]
Well, somebody told us Wall Street fell
But we were so poor that we couldn't tell
Cotton was short, and the weeds were tall
But Mr. Roosevelt a-gonna save us all
Well, momma got sick, and daddy got down
The county got the farm, and they moved to town
Poppa got a job with the TVA
We bought a washin' machine and then a Chevrolet

[Chorus]
Singin'
Song, Song of the South
Sweet potato pie, and I shut my mouth
Gone, Gone with the Wind
There ain't nobody lookin' back again
Play it

[Outro]
Singin'
Song, Song of the South
Sweet potato pie, and I shut my mouth
(Gone) Gone, Gone with the Wind
There ain't nobody lookin' back again
Song, Song of the South
(Gone) Gone, Gone with the Wind
Song, Song of the South
(Sweet potato pie, and I shut my mouth)
Song, Song of the South
(Sweet potato pie, and I shut my mouth)
Sing it
(Song, Song of the South)
(Sweet potato pie, and I shut my mouth)
(Gone, Gone with the Wind)
(Ain't nobody lookin' back again)
(Song, Song of the South)
(Sweet potato pie, and I shut my mouth)
(Gone, Gone with the Wind)
(Ain't nobody lookin' back again)
(Song, Song of the South)
(Sweet potato pie, and I shut my mouth)
