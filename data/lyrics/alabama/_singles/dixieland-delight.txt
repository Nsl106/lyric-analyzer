[Verse 1]
Rollin' down a backwoods Tennessee byway
One arm on the wheel
Holding my lover with the other
A sweet, soft, southern thrill
Worked hard all week, got a little jingle
On a Tennessee Saturday night
Couldn't feel better, I'm together
With my Dixieland Delight

[Chorus]
Spend my dollar, parked in a holler
'Neath the mountain moonlight
Hold her up tight
Make a little lovin'
A little turtle-dovin'
On a Mason-Dixon night
Fits my life, oh, so right
My Dixieland Delight

[Verse 2]
White-tail buck deer, munching on clover
Red-tail hawk, sitting on a limb
Chubby old groundhog, croaking bullfrog
Free as the feeling in the wind
Home-grown country girl, gonna give me a whirl
On a Tennessee Saturday night
Lucky as a seven, livin' in heaven
With my Dixieland Delight

[Chorus]
Spend my dollar, parked in a holler
'Neath the mountain moonlight
Hold her up tight
Make a little lovin'
A little turtle-dovin'
On a Mason-Dixon night
Fits my life, oh, so right
My Dixieland Delight

[Chorus]
Spend my dollar, parked in a holler
'Neath the mountain moonlight
Hold her up tight
Make a little lovin'
A little turtle-dovin'
On a Mason-Dixon night
Fits my life, oh, so right
My Dixieland Delight

[Outro]
Rolling down a backwoods Tennessee byway
One arm on the wheel
Holding my lover with the other
She's a sweet, soft, southern thrill
Worked hard all week, got a little jingle
On a Tennessee Saturday night
Couldn't feel better, I'm together
With my Dixieland Delight
