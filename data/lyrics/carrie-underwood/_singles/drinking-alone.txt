[Intro]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1]
Let me make one thing clear, you can buy me a beer
But you ain't taking me home
No pickup lines, I came here tonight
To shed a few tears on my own
But sitting there across the room, I couldn't help but notice you
Seem a little down on your luck too
Yeah, my heart might be breakin', but this seat ain't taken
And you've got me thinkin'

[Chorus]
We should be drinkin' alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems, we ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinkin' alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We should be drinkin' alone, together (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
I don't know what she did to make you hurt like this
But, I know just what to do
It starts with a bottle of good Reposado
And ends with a shooter or two
Tomorrow when the sun comes up, tonight’s the night that never was
Baby, just forget my name
Won't be your one and only, but just 'cause we're lonely
Don't mean that we should

[Chorus]
We should be drinkin' alone
'Cause drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems, we ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinkin' alone
Drinkin' alone, drinkin' alone (Together)
Maybe we shouldn't be drinkin' alone (We should be drinkin' alone)
Drinkin' alone, drinkin' alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinkin' alone

[Bridge]
I'll pretend that I care
Baby, pull up a chair
We'll stay here 'til they make us go home

[Chorus]
We should be drinkin' alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, we should be drinkin' alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems, we ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinkin' alone (Drinkin' alone, drinkin' alone), together
Maybe we shouldn't be drinkin' alone (We should be drinkin' alone)
Drinkin' alone, drinkin' alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Outro]
We should be drinkin' alone
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
