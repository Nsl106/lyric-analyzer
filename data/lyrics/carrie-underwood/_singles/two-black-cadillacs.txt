[Verse 1]
Two black Cadillacs driving in a slow parade
Headlights shining bright in the middle of the day
One is for his wife
The other for the woman who loved him at night
Two black Cadillacs meeting for the first time

[Chorus]
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry
(Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Yeah, they took turns layin' a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye bye

[Post-Chorus]
Two black Cadillacs
Two black Cadillacs

[Verse 2]
Two months ago, his wife called the number on his phone
Turns out he'd been lyin' to both of them for oh so long
They decided then, he'd never get away with doing this to them
Two black Cadillacs waiting for the right time, the right time

[Chorus]
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry
(Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Yeah-yeah, they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye
Yeah, yeah
(Two black Cadillacs)

[Bridge]
It was the first and the last time they saw each other face to face
They shared a crimson smile and just walked away
And left the secret at the grave

[Chorus]
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils, they didn't bother to cry
(Bye-bye, bye-bye) Yeah, yeah, yeah
They took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
