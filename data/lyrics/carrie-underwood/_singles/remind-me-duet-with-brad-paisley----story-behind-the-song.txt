Whenever I, uh, think of remind me, I think, of course Brad Paisley. Uhm, we, we had so much fun like recording that song and shooting the video and getting to perform it on various award shows and stuff like that. It's such a great song and I feel like it’s something that so many people can relate to, you know, when you have been married or have been together for a really long time. Uhm, you know, kind of just making that extra effort so hopefully some people heard that song and, and made them wanna, you know, rekindle the fires a little bit. But mainly I just, I really enjoy, ah, that I got to work with one of my really good friends on something like that.
