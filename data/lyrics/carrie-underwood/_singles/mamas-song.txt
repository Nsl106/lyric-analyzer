[Verse 1]
Mama, you taught me to do the right things
So, now you have to let your baby fly
You've given me everything that I will need
To make it through this crazy thing called life

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you watched me grow up
And only want what's best for me
And I think I found the answer to your prayers

[Chorus]
And he is good, so good
He treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No, he's never gonna leave
So, don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me

[Verse 2]
Mama, there's no way you'll ever lose me
Giving me away is not goodbye
As you watch me walk down to my future
I hope tears of joy are in your eyes

[Chorus]
'Cause he is good, so good
And he treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No, he's never gonna leave
So, don't you worry about me
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
Don't you worry about me
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)

[Bridge]
And when I watch my baby grow up
I only want what's best for her
And I hope she'll find the answer to our prayers
And that she'll say

[Chorus]
He is good, so good
And he treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No, he's never gonna leave
So, don't you worry about me
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
Don't you worry about me
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)

[Outro]
Mama, don't you worry about me
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
Don't you worry about me
