[Verse 1]
This woman takes on the world
And picks up you shirts, keeps it together somehow
(This same woman) That melts with your touch
Wants you to feel what I'm feeling right now

[Chorus]
'Cause this woman needs
A safe place to land
The strength in your hands
To know you know
What this woman needs
Is somewhere to cry (Somewhere to cry)
So lay by my side (So lay by my side)
And I'll tell you, I'll tell you

[Verse 2]
(This woman needs) To be reassured
That my heart's your home and love is what wills you to stay
(I need you to see me) In every light
And hear that you still think I'm beautiful anyway

[Chorus]
'Cause this woman needs
A safe place to land
The strength in your hands
To know you know
What this woman needs
Is somewhere to cry (Somewhere to cry)
So lay by my side (So lay by my side)
And I'll tell you, I'll tell you

[Outro]
What this woman needs
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, what this woman needs
Is somewhere to cry
So lay by my side
And I'll tell you, I'll tell you
What this woman needs
Yeah, what this woman needs
Yeah, yeah
What this woman needs
