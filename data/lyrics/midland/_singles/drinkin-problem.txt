[Verse 1]
One more night, one more down
One more, one more round
First one in, last one out
Giving this town lots to talk about
They don't know what they don't know

[Chorus]
People say I got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People saying that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all

[Post-Chorus]
They keep on talking
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem
I call it a solution

[Verse 2]
Last call gets later and later
I come in here so I don't have to hate her
Same old folks, same old songs
The same old same old blue neon
The same old buzz, just because

[Chorus]
People say I've got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People saying that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all

[Post-Chorus 2]
They keep on talking
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem
I call it a solution
Just sitting here in all my grand illusions
They call it a problem
I call it a solution

[Bridge]
Just a solution

[Chorus]
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all

[Post-Chorus 2]
They keep on talking
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem
I call it a solution
Sitting here in all my grand illusions
They call it a problem
I call it a solution
