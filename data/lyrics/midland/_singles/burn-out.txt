[Chorus]
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
I was so on fire for you, it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out

[Verse 1]
Just watchin' rivers run
Down the side of my bottle
Almost like it's cryin' my tears
Had the world on a string
And then I lost everything
And that's how I wound up here

[Chorus]
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothin' left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
Of a smoky memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done-me-wrong songs hit me so right
I was so on fire for you, it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out

[Verse 2]
If you put your hands on the flame
You got no right to complain
'Cause you know it's gonna leave a mark
When the glow comes to an end
Like scattered embers in the wind
Leaves you lookin' for a brand new spark
Watchin' cigarettes burn out

[Bridge]
No, with every hit, I'm gonna quit
But who am I kiddin'? I just can't put you down
So I keep hangin' around

[Chorus]
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothin' left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
Of a smoky memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done-me-wrong songs hit me so right
I was so on fire for you, it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out
I was so on fire for you, it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out

[Outro]
Woo
