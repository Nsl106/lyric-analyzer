[Verse 1]
Sometimes her jacket smells like cigarettes
But she hates the smoke
And when I ask her who she's hangin' out with
She says no one I would know

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I'm not
Maybe she's guilty, maybe she's caught

[Chorus]
She's bringin' back cheatin' songs
The kinda hurt that gets you singin' along
Somethin' circa 1973
She's lyin' with him and she's lyin' to me
She's bringin' back diamond rings
Slipped in the pocket of her tight-fittin' jeans
It's back in fashion doin' somebody wrong
She's bringin' back cheatin' songs

[Verse 2]
She used to call me on her way back home
But she don't call anymore
And when she's puttin' on that little black dress
Who's she wearin' it for?

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I'm jealous, wouldn't you be
If you saw the way she ain't lookin' at me?

[Chorus]
She's bringin' back cheatin' songs
The kinda hurt that gets you singin' along
Somethin' circa 1973
She's lyin' with him and she's lyin' to me
She's bringin' back diamond rings
Slipped in the pocket of her tight-fittin' jeans
It's back in fashion doin' somebody wrong
She's bringin' back cheatin' songs

[Bridge]
Steel guitars are back in style
Like tears fallin' over a smile
Yeah, it's been a while since country music loved a fool
Runnin' around was cool

[Chorus]
She's bringin' back cheatin' songs
The kinda hurt that gets you singin' along
Somethin' circa 1973
She's lyin' with him and she's lyin' to me
She's bringin' back diamond rings
Slipped in the pocket of her tight-fittin' jeans
It's back in fashion doin' somebody wrong
She's bringin' back cheatin' songs
She's bringin' back cheatin' songs
