[Verse 1]
I always said that'd be it
That I wouldn't stick around
If it ever came to this
And here I am
So confused
How am I supposed to leave?
When I can't even move

[PreChorus 1]
In the time it would have took to say
Honey I'm home how was your day?
You dropped a bomb right where we live
And just expect me to forgive

[Chorus]
Well that's a mighty big word for such a small man
And I'm not sure I can
Cause I don't even know now who I am
It's too soon for me to say forgive

[Verse 2]
I should ask but I won't
Was it love or just her touch
Cause I don't think I wanna know
So get you some things
And get out (get out, get out)
Don't call me for a day or two
So I can sort this out

[PreChorus 2]
Well you might as well've ripped the life
Right out of me
Right here tonight
And through the fallin tears you said
Can you ever just forgive?

[Chorus]
Well, thats a mighty big word for such a small man
And I'm not sure I can
Cause I don't even know now who I am
It's too soon for me to say forgive

[Bridge]
You know what they say
Forgive and Forget
Relive and Regret

[Chorus]
Forgive?
Well, thats a mighty big word for such a small man
And I'm not sure I can
Cause I don't even know now who I am
It's too soon for me to say forgive

[Outro]
Oh, It's too soon for me to say forgive
