[Verse 1]
If you drive around back in our old hometown
I wonder, do you think of me
When you drive by a school, do you remember two fools
I wonder, do you think of me

[Chorus]
And remember the park where you struck the spark
To a fire that's still burning oh, in my heart
That old graduation day you just drifted away
I wonder, do you think of me

[Verse 2]
And remember those games, those cold football games
I was your hero though I seldom played
Back then could you see what our future would be
I wonder, do you think of me

[Chorus]
And the classes we missed, caused by a kiss
I can tell you that I've never felt like that since
I don't know if you would, but I'd go back if I could
I wonder, do you think of me

[Tag]
I still love you
Do you think of me
