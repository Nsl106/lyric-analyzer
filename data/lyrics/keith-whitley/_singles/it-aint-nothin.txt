[Verse 1]
My boss is the boss' son and that makes for a real long day
When that day is finally done I'm facing forty-thousand cars on the Interstate
Feeling lower than a well digger's shoes
Knee deep in a mess of blues
But those blues just fade away
When I hear my baby say

[Chorus]
It ain't nothin' a little bit of love won't fix
It ain't nothin' but a scratch, a little bit of love can't stitch
It ain't nothin' a little bit of love can't heal
Your love makes me feel
No matter what hell life deals
It ain't nothin', it ain't nothin'

[Verse 2]
It was written all over her face
She was about to climb the walls
She said you gotta get me out of this place
'Cause even Cinderella got to go to the ball
If you multiply hell times three
That's what this day's been like for me
I said, "Honey, we'll do the town
Just don't let it get you down"

[Chorus]
'Cause it ain't nothin' a little bit of love won't fix
It ain't nothin' but a scratch a little bit of love can't stitch
It ain't nothin' a little bit of love can't heal
Your love makes me feel
No matter what hell life deals
It ain't nothin'

[Chorus]
It ain't nothin' a little bit of love won't fix
It ain't nothin' but a scratch a little bit of love can't stitch
It ain't nothin' a little bit of love can't heal
Your love makes me feel
No matter what hell life deals
It ain't nothin', it ain't nothin'

[Tag]
Naw, it ain't nothin'
It ain't nothin'
Naw, it ain't nothin'
Well it ain't nothin'
Naw, it ain't nothin'
Naw, it ain't nothin'
It ain't nothin'
Naw, it ain't nothin'
