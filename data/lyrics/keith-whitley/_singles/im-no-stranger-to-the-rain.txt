[Verse 1]
I'm no stranger to the rain
I'm a friend of thunder
Friend, is it any wonder lightnin' strikes me
I've fought with the devil
Got down on his level
But I never gave in, so he gave up on me

[Verse 2]
I'm no stranger to the rain
I can spot bad weather
And I'm good at finding shelter in a downpour
I've been sacrificed by brothers
Crucified by lovers
But through it all I withstood the pain
I'm no stranger to the rain

[Bridge]
But when I get that foggy feelin'
When I'm a feelin' down
If I don't keep my head up, I may drown
But it's hard to keep believing
I'll even come out even
While the rain beats your hope in the ground
And tonight it's really comin' down

[Verse 3]
I'm no stranger to the rain
But there'll always be tomorrow
And I'll beg, steal, or borrow a little sunshine
And I'll put this cloud behind me
That's how the Man designed me
To ride the wind and dance in a hurricane
I'm no stranger to the rain
Oh no, I'm no stranger to the rain

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
I'm no stranger to the rain
I'm a friend of thunder
Friend, is it any wonder lightning strikes me
But I'll put this cloud behind me
That's how the Man designed me
Ride the wind and dance in a hurricane
I'm no stranger to the rain, oh no
I'm no stranger to the rain
