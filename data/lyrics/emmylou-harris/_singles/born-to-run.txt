[Verse 1]
Well I never did crawl and I never did toe the line
No man is master to me, I ain't that kind
I just put on my traveling shoes
If you want to win, you just can't lose the time
Or stay behind

[Chorus]
Well I was born to run to get ahead of the rest
And all that I wanted was to be the best
Just to feel free and be someone
I was born to be fast, I was born to run

[Verse 2]
Well, I take the chances, sometimes I made mistakes
But you don't get nothing unless you take the breaks
Living is dangerous as dynamite
Sure it makes you feel nervous, but it makes you feel alright
Makes you feel alright

[Chorus]
Well I was born to run to get ahead of the rest
And all that I wanted was to be the best
Just to feel free and be someone
I was born to be fast, I was born to run

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Nobody going to make me do the things their way
By the time you figure it out, it's yesterday
Well it comes to he who waits, I'm told
But I don't need it when I'm old and gray
Yeah, I want it today

[Chorus]
Well I was born to run, to get ahead of the rest
And all that I wanted was to be the best
Just to feel free and be someone
I was born to be fast, I was born to run

[Chorus]
I was born to run to get ahead of the rest
And all that I wanted was to be the best
Just to feel free and be someone
I was born to be fast, I was born to run
