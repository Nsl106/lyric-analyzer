[Verse]
Beneath still waters, there's a strong undertow
The surface won't tell you what the deep water knows
Darling, I'm saying I know something's wrong
Beneath still waters, your love is gone

[Chorus]
Even a fool could see that you'll soon be leaving me
But each and every heart must take its turn at misery
And this time it's me and I'll cry alone
Beneath still waters, your love is gone

[Pedal Steel Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Even a fool could see that you'll soon be leaving me
But each and every heart must take its turn at misery
And this time it's me and I'll cry alone
Beneath still waters, your love is gone

[Outro]
Beneath still waters, your love is gone
Beneath still waters, your love is gone
