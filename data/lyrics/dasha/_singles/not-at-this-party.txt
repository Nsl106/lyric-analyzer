[Verse 1]
Deep breath, big smile, it's been a while
Since I've been in a crowd like this
Stay off the wall, don't think, just talk
Pray no one says the name I miss

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm drunk here in the bathroom line
I'm checkin' my phone just one more time
Case you hit me with an un-goodbye
And I fix myself up in the mirror
And walk out with a shitty beer
Even though they've seen me here

[Chorus]
I'm not at this party, I'm back in your backseat
You're pullin' it over, you just had to have me
I can't hear this music, 'cause I'm hearin' you yell
You're so in love with me, but right now, you need to work on yourself, mm
And they think I've moved on with my life
That I'm havin' a good night
Out here on this dance floor, just like everybody
But nobody here knows just how bad you got me
I'm not at this party

[Verse 2]
And I'm good (I'm good), I'm great (I'm great), don't say (Don't say) your name (Your name)
Just talk about the weather instead (La, la, la)
Just stay (Don't stay), don't leave (Don't leave), so they (So they) can't see (Can't see)
What's steamin' up the glass in my hand

[Chorus]
I'm not at this party, I'm back in your backseat
You're pullin' it over, you just had to have me
I can't hear this music, 'cause I'm hearin' you yell
You're so in love with me, but right now, you need to work on yourself, mm
And they think I've moved on with my life
That I'm havin' a good night
Out here on this dance floor, just like everybody
But nobody here knows just how bad you got me
I'm not at this party

[Bridge]
And I'm drunk here in the bathroom line
I'm checkin' my phone just one more time
Case you hit me with an un-goodbye
I know you won't, but
I'll fix myself up in the mirror
And walk out with a shitty beer
Even though they've seen me here

[Chorus]
I'm not at this party, I'm back in your backseat
You're pullin' it over, you just had to have me
I can't hear this music, 'cause I'm hearin' you yell
You're so in love with me, but right now, you need to work on yourself, mm
And they think I've moved on with my life (My life)
That I'm havin' a good night
Out here on this dance floor, just like everybody
But nobody here knows just how bad you got me
I'm not at this party

[Outro]
I'm not at this party
