[Verse 1]
There's a little moonlight, dancin' on the sand
There's a warm breeze blowin' by the ocean as you're taking my hand
You need to know where I'm standing now
That I'm right on the edge of giving in to ya
Baby, it's a long way down

[Chorus]
If I fall, can you let me down easy?
If I leave my heart with you tonight
Will you promise me that you're gonna treat it right?
I'm barely hangin' on
If I fall, can you let me down easy?

[Verse 2]
The scent of your perfume, floatin' in the air
You're looking like an angel, lyin' on a blanket with a halo of hair
And those lips, look to good to be true
Once I taste that kiss, I know what'll happen
I'll be at the mercy of you

[Chorus]
If I fall, can you let me down easy?
If I leave my heart with you tonight
Will you promise me that you're gonna treat it right?
I'm barely hangin' on
So if I fall, can you let me down easy?

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
If I fall, can you let me down easy?
If I leave my heart with you tonight
Will you promise me, girl, you're gonna treat it right?
I'm barely hangin' on
So if I fall, can you let me down easy?
If I fall, can you let me down easy?

[Outro]
Let me down easy, babe
Mmm
