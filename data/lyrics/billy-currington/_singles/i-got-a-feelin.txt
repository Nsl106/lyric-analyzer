[Verse 1]
I don't want to rush this thing
I don't want to jump the gun
I really want to say those three little words
But I'm going to bite my tongue

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm just gonna lay on back
Leave it on cruise control
I'm gonna hold it all inside
'Til the right time comes down the road

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a feelin'
My head's a reelin'
My heart is screamin'
I'm about to bust loose

[Chorus]
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an I
And ends with a you
I got a feelin'
Are you feelin' it too?

[Verse 3]
I guess I've all but said it now
So much for hopin' you'd go first
Don't leave me hangin' out here on the line
Baby, it's your turn

[Verse 4]
Say you couldn't sleep last night
Swore that you could feel me breathe
Had you wanting me there by your side
Yeah, baby I know what you mean

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a feelin'
My head's a reelin'
My heart is screamin'
I'm about to bust loose

[Chorus]
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an I
And ends with a you
I got a feelin'
You're feelin' it too

[Chorus]
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an I
And ends with a you
I got a feelin'
You're feelin' it too

[Outro]
You're feelin' it too
Yeah, you're feelin' it too
You're feelin' it too
Oh yeah
