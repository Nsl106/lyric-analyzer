(Verse 1)
It only hurts for a little while
That’s what they tell me
That’s what they say
Oh, it only hurts for a little while
Then all your heartaches
Will pass away

(Chorus)
It’s so easy to be smart
With somebody else’s heart
But I don’t know how to start
Forgetting you what can I do

(Verse 2)
It only hurts for a little while
That’s what they tell me
Just wait and see
But I will hurt
‘Till you come back to me

(instr.)

(Verse 3)
It only hurts for a little while
That’s what they tell me
That’s what they say
It only hurts for a little while
That’s what they tell me
Just wait and see
But I will hurt
‘Till you come back to me
