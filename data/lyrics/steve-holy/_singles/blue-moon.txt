No, I haven't seen the sky tonight
Too many clouds, there's no starlight
But I know it's true
There must be a blue moon

I got the message you left early today
No signs, no warnings to give you away
Not even goodbye
It was the only way

There's a blue moon out tonight
No, I don't see it but I feel its light
Come pouring through the clouds you left above my head
There's a blue moon out tonight
No misconceptions, yes, I know it's right
'cause I've never been so blue in all my life

No, don't call a friend 'cause nobody should know
It's just between me, my heart and my soul
And the memories perfectly placed in my mind
The more I think it over, well, the more I know it's true
The reason you left me, why I'm feeling so blue…
There must be a blue moon

There's a blue moon out tonight
No, I don't see it but I feel its light
Come pouring through the clouds you left above my head
There's a blue moon out tonight
No misconceptions, yes, I know it's right
'cause I've never been so blue in all my life

There's a blue moon out tonight
No misconceptions, yes, I know it's right
'cause I've never been so blue in all my life

No, I haven't seen the sky tonight
Too many clouds, there's no starlight
But I know it's true
There must be a blue moon
