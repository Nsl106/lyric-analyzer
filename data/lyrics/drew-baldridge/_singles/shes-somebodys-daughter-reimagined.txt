[Verse 1]
She's more than just a pretty face
In a late-night bar
More than just a pair of tight jeans
Sitting in your car
She's more than a last call kiss
Or a one night stand
Remember boy you weren't the first
To hold her hand

[Chorus]
She's somebody's daughter
She's somebody's everything
She's somebody's little girl
Even if she's grown up and moved away
She's somebody's whole world
She's somebody's baby
And if you don't treat her right
Hers won't be the only heart you're breaking

[Refrain]
She's somebody's daughter

[Verse 2]
Her daddy bought her her first car
Taught her how to drive
Scared her senior prom date
Under that porch light
Her mama wiped away the tears
From her first heartbreak
And said, "Honey, he ain't good enough
For you anyway"

[Chorus]
She's somebody's daughter
She's somebody's everything
She's somebody's little girl
Even if she's grown up and moved away
She's somebody's whole world
She's somebody's baby
And if you don't treat her right
Hers won't be the only heart you're breaking

[Refrain]
She's somebody's daughter
She's somebody's daughter

[Bridge]
She's a picture on the mantle above a fireplace
She's pigtails blowing out candles on her birthday cake
She's a driving off to college, tear in her mama's eyes
Yeah, she's a daddy's girl, better treat her right

[Refrain]
'Cause she's somebody's daughter
She's somebody's daughter, yeah

[Chorus]
She's somebody's whole world
She's somebody's baby
And if you don't treat her right
Hers won't be the only heart you're breaking
She's somebody's daughter
She's somebody's daughter
Yeah, she's somebody's daughter
She's somebody's daughter
