Here she comes
And just look at the way she's smiling
Lord, I wish I had somewhere to hide
I didn't mean for her to see me crying
Somebody hold me until she passes by

She's closer now
I've never seen her look so lovely
But she always did look good in white
She'll be his in just a minute now
And it's killing me
Somebody hold me until she passes by

I hear the music playing ''Here Comes The Bride''
But look at her forever
She'll never be mine
There she is
I wanna touch her so bad I could die
Somebody hold me until she passes by

I come to say goodbye
But I wish it was me
Standing by her side
Somebody hold me until she passes by
