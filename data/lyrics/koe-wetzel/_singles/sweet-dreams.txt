[Intro]
A man like me would keep it to himself
A bigger man would say it to your face
Yeah I ain't doing good and you can tell
Was I the only one you couldn't save?
I hate to be the reason that you're crying
The way you always knew when I was lying
And breaking your heart was getting tiring
I knew I had to let you go

[Chorus]
It's hard to have Sweet Dreams when I'm such a nightmare
I don't wanna talk about it rather not go there
When I find a good thing I burn it down slow
Only see your face now when my eyes are closed
It's so hard to have sweet dreams
Sweet dreams
It's so hard to have sweet dreams

[Verse]
I bet you're out living guilt free
The only thing you battle is your memory of me
Shit, I ain't slept in weeks
Been trying everything from Ambien to THC

[Chorus]
It's so hard to have Sweet Dreams when I'm such a nightmare
I don't wanna talk about it rather not go there
When I find a good thing I burn it down slow
Only see your face now when my eyes are closed
It's so hard to have sweet dreams
And I thought you should know that
I been getting no sleep
And I probably deserve that
When I find a good thing I burn it down slow
Only see your face now when my eyes are closed
It's so hard to have sweet dreams
Sweet dreams
It's so hard to have sweet dreams

[Bridge]
The nights keep getting longer
And you're still in my head
So I turn on all the lights
And I wrote you this

[Chorus]
It's so hard to have Sweet Dreams when I'm such a nightmare
I don't wanna talk about it rather not go there
When I find a good thing I burn it down slow
Only see your face now when my eyes are closed
It's so hard to have sweet dreams
And I thought you should know that
I been getting no sleep
And I probably deserve that
When I find a good thing I burn it down slow
Only see your face now when my eyes are closed
It's so hard to have sweet dreams
Sweet dreams
It's so hard to have sweet dreams
Sweet dreams
