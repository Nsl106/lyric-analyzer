[Verse 1: Koe Wetzel]
I can tell that you're mad
And I ain't half surprised about that
Since the day that we met
It's always who cuts first and never who bleeds last
Rumors always turn into yelling and fighting
And once it's in your mind, only one way you're driving

[Chorus: Koe Wetzel]
I know, I know
I'ma take the high road, maybe get stoned
Have a little too much of something terrible
I'ma let you cool down while I walk out
You ain't messing me up like the times before
I don't need a ticket to your shit show
Knock yourself out and hit a new low
Well, I'ma take the high road, take the high road, take the high road

[Verse 2: Jessie Murph]
You don't wanna talk about it, boy, that's no surprisе
You come home smelling likе liquor like every other night
If I catch you with her, you gon' catch me with him
You think I don't hear about it, you better think again
You know that rumors always turn into yelling and fighting
And once it's in my mind, only one way I'm driving

[Chorus: Koe Wetzel & Jessie Murph]
You know, I know
I'ma take the high road, maybe get stoned
Have a little too much of something terrible
I'ma let you cool down while I walk out
You ain't messing me up like the times before
I don't need a ticket to your shit show
Knock yourself out and hit a new low
Well, I'ma take the high road, take the high road, take the high road
Whoa, whoa

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Koe Wetzel & Jessie Murph]
I'ma take the high road, maybe get stoned
Have a little too much of something terrible
I'ma let you cool down while I walk out
You ain't messing me up like the times before
And I don't need a ticket to your shit show
Knock yourself out and hit a new low
Well I'ma take the high road, take the high road, take the high road
I'ma take the high road, take the high road, take the high road
Oh, yeah, yeah, mm
