[Verse 1]
Today I wanted to write a tune
Started strummin' this little groove
I could've wrote about love, or money
Something sad, or something funny

[Chorus]
But hey, hey, hey what's so wrong
With one more drinkin' song?
Hold up your cups and sing along
To one more drinkin' song

[Verse 2]
And if by chance this brings you cheer
Maybe someday you'll bring me a beer
Or not to mention my favorite drink
A marga-daiquiri-screw-aloda-on the beach

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey what's so wrong
With one more drinkin' song?
Hold up your cups and sing along
To one more drinkin' song

[Bridge]
So here's to cheap whiskey and fine wine
Buyin' shots and pick up lines
And here's to bartenders tryin' to get paid
When all of us are tryin' to get ---

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey what's so wrong
With one more drinkin' song?
Hold up your cups and sing along
To one more drinkin' song
(Oh now you wanna sing along)

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey what's so wrong
With one more drinkin' song?
Hold up your cups and sing along
To one more drinkin' song

[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey what's so wrong
With one more drinkin' song?
Hold up your cups and sing along
To one more drinkin' song
