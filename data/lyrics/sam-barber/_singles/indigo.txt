[Verse 1: Sam Barber]
I know you're worried at night, I won't find my way
And I'm tired of lyin' to myself just to get through each day
My head says, "I shoulda never left"
And that my feet will soon lead to my death

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Barber]
I'm startin' to question
If God's tryna teach me a lesson
I'm startin' to wonder
If my true colors changed since I left ya

[Chorus: Sam Barber & Avery Anna]
I used to shine bright like gold, now I'm all indigo
My colors are darker and cold, I think it's time that I went home
And I don't understand why I always feel dead and alone
Well, I used to shine bright like gold, now I'm all indigo

[Verse 2: Avery Anna]
I gave up a piece of my heart, then I turned to run
Oh, my head's in the clouds, but I don't feel close to the sun
And the light fades away from my face, and the tears fall like rain
So I turn my words all into faith, hope it's me that they save

[Pre-Chorus: Avery Anna]
Oh, I'm startin' to question
If God's tryna teach me a lesson
Lord knows I'm startin' to wonder
If my true colors changed since I left ya

[Chorus: Sam Barber & Avery Anna]
I used to shine bright like gold, now I'm all indigo
My colors are darker and cold, I think it's time that I went home
And I don't understand why I always feel dead and alone
Well, I used to shine bright like gold, now I'm all indigo

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Barber & Avery Anna, Avery Anna]
I'm startin' to question
If God's tryna teach me a lesson
(Lord knows) I'm startin' to wonder
If my true colors changed since I left ya

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Sam Barber & Avery Anna]
I used to shine bright like gold, now I'm all indigo
My colors are darker and cold, I think it's time that I went home
And I don't understand why I always feel dead and alone
I used to shine bright like gold, now I'm all indigo
Now I'm all indigo

[Outro: Avery Anna]
