The way you laugh, the way you cry
The way that you smile without meaning to
The way you look me in the eye
I think about it all the time

The day we met, the dress you wore
You didn't know I was watching you
I've seen your face somewhere before
And I think about it all the time

This wasn't supposed to happen to me
I'm used to how it used to be
It's not like I've got nothing to do
But I can't keep my mind off you
No I cannot keep my mind off you

You're not a thought that comes and goes
You're more than a dream or a fantasy
Where it will lead love only knows
But I think about it all the time
Alright...

This wasn't supposed to happen to me
I'm used to how it used to be
It's not like I've got nothing to do
But I can't keep my mind off you
No I cannot keep my mind off you

The way you laugh, the way you cry
The way that you smile without meaning to
I'm just a man, I can't deny
I think about it all the time

I'm just a man, I can't deny
I think about it all the time
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I think about it all the time
All the time

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I think about it all the time
Good God!

Oooh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I think about it all the time
Yes I do
