[Verse 1]
Rosie never was one for turning heads
She was just always kinda there
She had a few nice features more or less
No red ribbons in her hair

[Pre-Chorus]
Since that Jesse's been coming to the diner
Folks are saying that she's never looked finer
She's got a different air

[Chorus]
She's taken a shine to him
Becoming the woman that she's never been
And all of the guys
Are wishing they hadn't been so blind
She's taken a shine to life
Now there's a sparkle in her eye
They all missed a gem, a diamond within
She's taken a shine

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Rosie hardly ever missed a bit of work
Never took vacation days
Home or the diner, it was all the same to her
She didn't know any other way

[Pre-Chorus]
But each afternoon, now she starts to come alive
'Cause Jesse's there each day to pick her up at five
You oughta hear them say

[Chorus]
She's taken a shine to him
Becoming the woman that she's never been
And all of the guys
Are wishing they hadn't been so blind
She's taken a shine to life
Now there's a sparkle in her eye
They all missed a gem, a diamond within
She's taken a shine

[Bridge]
Oh, what a little love can do
Now that she's found herself
She's stronger than she ever knew

[Chorus]
She's taken a shine to him
Becoming the woman that she's never been
And all of the guys
Are wishing they hadn't been so blind
She's taken a shine to life
Now there's a sparkle in her eye
They all missed a gem, a diamond within
She's taken a shine (Shine)
