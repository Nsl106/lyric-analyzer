[Verse 1]
It's been a long time since I held her close
We misplaced feelings that we used to know
Thought I could see between the lines I read
I wasn't ready we she turned to me and said

[Chorus]
I can't eat and I can't sleep
Sometimes I find it hard to breathe
I breakdown and cry not knowing why, now I can't lie
I'm standing on the edge of goodbye

[Verse 2]
All of the those years came rushin through my mind
I found myself back.. in a simpler time
Just two young kids runnin on fire and dreams
And in her eyes I realized, she was calling out to me

[Chorus]
She said, "I can't eat and I can't sleep
Sometimes I find it hard to breathe
I breakdown and cry not knowing why, now I can't lie
I'm standing on the edge of goodbye"

[Bridge]
I would do anything to let her know
There just no way my heart can, let her go

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't eat and I can't sleep
Sometimes I find it hard to breathe
I breakdown and cry not knowing why, now I can't lie
I'm standing on the edge of goodbye

[Tag]
Standing on the edge of goodbye
Standing on the edge of goodbye
Standing on the edge of goodbye...
