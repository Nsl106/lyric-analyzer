[Verse1]
I've seen the seven wonders of the world
I've seen the beauty of diamonds and pearls
But they ain't nothing, baby
Your love amazes me

[Verse 2]
I've seen a sunset that would make you cry
And colors of a rainbow reaching 'cross the sky
The moon in all its phases
But your love amazes me

[Chorus]
Don't you ever doubt this love of mine
You're the only one for me
You give me hope, you give me reason
You give me something to believe in
Forever faithfully
Your love amazes me

[Post-Chorus]
Mm, your love

[Verse 3]
I've prayed for miracles that never came
I got down on my knees out in the pouring rain
But only you could save me
Your love amazes me

[Chorus]
Don't you ever doubt this love of mine
You're the only one for me
You give me hope, you give me reason
You give me something to believe in
Forever faithfully
Your love amazes me

[Outro]
Your love (Your love)
Your love amazes me
Your love amazes me (Your love)
I got down on my knees
Your love (Your love)
Your love amazes me
Only you, only you, babe
But only you could save
Your love amazes
