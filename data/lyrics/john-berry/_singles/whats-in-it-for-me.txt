[Verse 1]
You're back at my door, the one you walked out
You made a mistake, you know that now
Will I let you in? You're begging me please
What if I do, what's in it for me?

[Chorus]
What's in it for me? I've got to ask
If it's only more tears, then I'll have to pass
If you'll open up, then I can see
Deep in your heart, what's in it for me

[Verse 2]
Well, I have to admit I'm glad that you're here
But I can't make the past just disappear
If you're back for good, I want you to be
Just let me know what's in it for me

[Chorus]
What's in it for me? I've got to ask
If it's only more tears, then I'll have to pass
If you'll open up, then I can see
Deep in your heart, what's in it for me

[Bridge]
Am I a fool to think you've changed?
Some people do, is that so strange?
Our love was good, it just got off track
Is it worth the risk if you come back?

[Chorus]
What's in it for me? I've got to ask
If it's only more tears, then I'll have to pass
If you'll open up, then I can see
Deep in your heart, what's in it for me

[Outro]
If you'll open up, then I can see
Deep in your heart, what's in it for me
