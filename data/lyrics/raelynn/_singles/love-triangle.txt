[Verse 1]
Sittin' on the front step, little white suitcase
Hearin' that diesel, 'fore it hit the front gate
His headlights burnin' down a Friday night
Southern belle statue standing in the screen door
Watchin' her whole world head for an old Ford
With a man that can't look her in the eye

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I'll run to him, big hug, jump in
And I cry for her out the window

[Chorus]
Some mamas and daddies are lovin' in a straight line
Take forever to hearten and take a long sweet ride
But some mamas and daddies let their heartstrings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck in a love triangle

[Verse 2]
Bowlin' alley burger, fries and a milkshake
Headed to the same old two dollar matinee
Baby, how's your school been and how's your mom?
Patsy Cline echoes back off the dashboard
Starin' at my boots and the dusty old floorboard
Baby, two weeks ain't really all that long

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I'll run to her
Wrap my arms around her skirt
And I cry (I cry) for him out the window

[Chorus]
Some mamas and daddies are lovin' in a straight line
Take forever to hearten and take a long sweet ride
But some mamas and daddies let their heartstrings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck in a love triangle
In a love triangle, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Some mamas and daddies are loving in a straight line
Take forever to hearten and take a long sweet ride
But some mamas and daddies let their heartstrings tear and tangle, oh
And some mamas and daddies ran out of love in '94
And some mamas and daddies don't even talk no more
And some mamas and daddies let their heartstrings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck and some of us grow up
In a love triangle
