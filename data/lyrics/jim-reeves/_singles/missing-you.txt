Missing you, can't help but wish that you
Were in my arms tonight, making love to me
Kissing you, that's all I want to do
It never seems just right now that we're apart

I always spend my time
Just writing lines to you
Can't wait for you to write
Saying you love me too

Missing you can't help but wish that you
Were in my arms tonight making love to me
(I always spend my time just writing lines to you)
(Can't wait for you to write saying you love me too.)

Missing you can't help but wish that you
Were in my arms tonight making love to me...
