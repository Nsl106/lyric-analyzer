Two doors down
They're laughing
And drinking and having a party
And two doors down
They're not aware that I'm around

And here I am crying my heart out
Feeling sorry
They're having a party
Just two doors down

Lying across my lonely bed
In this lonely old apartment
Crying about the way
That life's been kicking me around

My love of yesterday has come
But he promised no tomorrows
But they're feeling no sorrow
Just two doors down

Two doors down
They're laughing
And drinking and having a party
And two doors down
They're not aware that I'm around

And here I am crying my heart out
Feeling sorry
They're having a party
Just two doors down

I think I'll dry these useless tears
And get myself together
I think I'll wander down the hall
And have a look around

Cause I can't stay inside
This lonely room and cry forever
I think I'd really rather join 'em
Two doors down

Two doors down
They're laughing
And drinking and having a party
And two doors down
They're all aware that I'm around

And here I am
No longer crying and feeling sorry
They're having a party
Just two doors down

I can't believe I'm standing here
Dry eyed
All smiles and talking
Making conversation with
The new love I've found

I ask him if he'd like to be alone
So we start walking
Down the hall to my place
Waiting two doors down

Two doors down
They're laughing
And drinking and having a party
But two doors down
We're not aware that they're around

Here I am
Feeling everything but sorry
We're having our own party
Two doors down, yeah

Two doors down
They're laughing
And drinking and having a party
And two doors down
We're not aware that they're around

Here I am
Feeling everything but sorry
