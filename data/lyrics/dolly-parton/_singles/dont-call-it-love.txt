Nobody believes that I really care for you
They don't think my heart is true
I don't think you agree
You know I'm a lifetime guarantee
So if they ask you what you mean to me

Don't call it love, Heavens above
We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love because that ain't enough
Just tell them you're my everything
Go on and tell them baby

Nobody believes we got something they haven't got
They've never seen a fire this hot
They never got that far
We're burning as bright as any star
So if they ask you what your feelings are

Don't call it love, Heavens above
We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love because that ain't enough
Just tell them you're my everything
Go ahead and tell them baby

Feels so good holding tight
Loving you through the night
Oh and they can call it what they like
But they ain't got it right, no, no, no

Don't call it love, Heaven's above
We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love because that ain't enough
Just tell them you're my everything

Don't call it love, Heaven's above
We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love because that ain't enough
Just tell them you're my everything

Don't call it love, Heaven's above
We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love because that ain't enough
Just tell them you're my everything
