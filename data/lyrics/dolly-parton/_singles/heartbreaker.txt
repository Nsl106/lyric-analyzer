[Verse 1]
Here I sit, all alone
Thinking 'bout what I should have known
You made me think that I could need you
You weaved your magic spell and I believed you

[Verse 2]
Looking back on you and me
Promises that will never be
I truly thought that we were lovers
But now I find I'm just like all the others

[Chorus]
Heartbreaker
Wish I'd seen, but love is blind
Sweet little love maker
Taking my heart and leave me behind
Heartbreaker
Couldn't you be just a little more kind to me?

[Verse 3]
Played with fire, felt its burn
I would have thought that I would have learned
I melted every time you kissed me
Each time you would leave, I thought that you would miss me

[Chorus]
Heartbreaker
Wish I'd seen, but love is blind
Sweet little love maker
Taking my heart and leave me behind
Heartbreaker
Couldn't you be just a little more kind to me?

[Chorus]
Heartbreaker
Wish I'd seen, but love is blind
Sweet little love maker
Taking my heart and leave me behind
Heartbreaker
Couldn't you be just a little more kind to me?

[Chorus]
Heartbreaker
Wish I'd seen, but love is blind
Sweet little love maker
Taking my heart and leave me behind
Heartbreaker
Couldn't you be just a little more kind to me?
