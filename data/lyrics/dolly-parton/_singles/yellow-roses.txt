[Verse 1]
"Hello," you said the day we met
Handing me a yellow rose
You asked me out and to your surprise
And to mine, I said I'd go
I thought it so romantic
And I found you sweet and bold
Though we'd only met
I still said yes to a single yellow rose

[Verse 2]
And for years to come, you were the one
To sleep with me at night
To laugh and talk and share my thoughts
And hold me when I'd cry
And on every rare occasion
And for no good reason too
A big bouquet or a single yellow rose
Was sent from you

[Chorus]
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go?
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds?
I still love you so

[Verse 3]
I never see a yellow rose
That I don't think of you
It's still my favorite flower
Though the yellows turned to blue
The day you left, my teardrops fell
Upon your farewell note
You said goodbye like you said hello
With a single yellow rose

[Chorus]
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go?
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds?
Oh, I still love you so
Yellow roses (Yellow roses)
The color of sunshine (The color of sunshine)
You loved me at one time (You loved me at one time)
Why did you have to go? (But you have to go)
Yellow roses (Sweet yellow roses)
Are you sending your new love (Are you sending your new love)
My bright yellow rose buds? (My bright yellow rose buds)
I still love you so (I still love you)
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
