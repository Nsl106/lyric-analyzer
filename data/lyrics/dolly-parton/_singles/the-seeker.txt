I am a seeker, a poor sinful creature
There is no weaker than I am
I am a seeker and you are a teacher
You are a reacher, so reach down
Reach out and lead me, guide me and keep me
In the shelter of your care each day

'Cause I am a seeker and you are a keeper
You are a leader, won't you show me the way?

I am a vessel that's empty and useless
I am a bad seed that fell by the way
I am a loser that wants to be a winner
And you are my last hope, don't turn me away

I am a seeker, a poor sinful creature
There is no weaker than I am
I am a seeker and you are a teacher
You are a reacher, so reach down
Reach out and lead me, guide me and keep me
In the shelter of your care each day

'Cause I am a seeker and you are a keeper
You are a leader, won't you show me the way?

Oh, and you are a mountain (Oh)
From which there flows a fountain
So let its water wash my sins away
'Cause I am a seeker, and you are a keeper
You are a teacher, won't you teach me the way?
Reach out and lead me, guide me and keep me
In the shelter of your care each day
