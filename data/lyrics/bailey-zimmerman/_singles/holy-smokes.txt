[Verse 1]
Well, I was only scared of the devil and her dad
So we'd park somewhere we knew they'd never look
No, I never seen nothin' like her
Playing with the flame on her momma's lighter
No, it wasn't very long 'fore I was hooked

[Chorus]
Heaven was a preacher's spot in that first church parking lot
Her hangin' onto me like the cross on a rearview does
Her eyes were blue, thе words were red, on that half pack of cigarеttes
At seventeen that's what hallelujah was
Life wasn't heavy in the back of that Chevy
Me, her, and the Holy Ghost
Somethin' 'bout us, hell of a rush
Fallin' in love, lightin' up them holy smokes  (Oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
They'd run us off but we'd come runnin' back
And we'd pick up where we left off the night before
She said "How pissed off would your mama be
If we walked in there and you married me?"
Even if we never made it through them old wood doors

[Chorus]
Heaven was a preacher's spot in that first church parkin' lot
Her hangin' onto me like the cross on the rearview does
Her eyes were blue, the words were red, on that half pack of cigarettes
At seventeen that's what hallelujah was
Life wasn't heavy in the back of that Chevy
Me, her, and the Holy Ghost
Somethin' 'bout us, hell of a rush
Fallin' in love, lightin' up them holy smokes (Oh, oh)

[Bridge]
Nothin' 'bout those nights felt like sinnin'
And Jesus forgives, but I can't forget when

[Chorus]
Heaven was a preacher's spot in that first church parkin' lot
Her hangin' onto me like the cross on the rearview does
Her eyes were blue, the words were red, on that half pack of cigarettes
At seventeen that's what hallelujah was
Life wasn't heavy in the back of that Chevy
Me, her, and the Holy Ghost
Somethin' 'bout us, hell of a rush
Fallin' in love, lightin' up them holy smokes  (Oh, oh)
