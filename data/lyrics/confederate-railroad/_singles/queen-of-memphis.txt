[Verse 1]
I hitchhiked up to Memphis, a young boy in my prime
I thought that big old city could ease my Georgia mind
After just one hour, I met this Southern girl
She said, "They call me the Queen of Memphis"
Then she took me around the world

[Chorus]
And I saw stars dancing on the water
I heard Elvis singing Blue Suede Shoes
That old muddy river was my witness
The night I fell in love with the Queen of Memphis

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I woke up the next morning a prisoner of her charm
She showed me things I'd never seen back there on that farm
She set my soul on fire, she fulfilled all my dreams
A boy became a man that night in the arms of the Memphis Queen

[Chorus]
And I saw stars dancing on the water
I heard Elvis singing Blue Suede Shoes
That old muddy river was my witness
The night I fell in love with the Queen of Memphis

[Bridge]
Just like that old man river
She keeps rolling through my mind
And you know I won't forget her
'Cause she was one of a kind

[Chorus]
And I saw stars dancing on the water
I heard Elvis singing Blue Suede Shoes
That old muddy river was my witness
The night I fell in love with the Queen of Memphis

[Outro]
And I am still in love with the Queen of Memphis
