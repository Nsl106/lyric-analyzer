All my friends say, I should leave you alone
You've got a heart like a stone, And a wonderin' eye
And I know that they're right
I can make up my mind, Not to see you again
But you move through my dreams like the wind
It's no good to pretend, It won't happen again
Cause it'll happen again

Some fools never learn
Play with the fire
And your gonna get burned
It's only love when your loved in return
Some fools never learn
Some fools never learn

And baby I tried, But I'm just not that strong
Yes, I knew all along, But that's not enough ...
I was falling in love
And you don't know it, But I came over tonight
There was somebody's car parked outside
Damn my eyes, Damn this heart of mine
I drove off into the night

Some fools never learn
Play with the fire
And your gonna get burned
It's only love when your loved in return
Some fools never learn
Some fools never learn

Somewhere in the city tonight
There's a girl and she's lonely like me
She'll be easy to see
And naturally, She'll have that look in her eyes
She'll be feeling that way
I see it all plain as day
Oh, I'll never be, what she wants me to be
Oh, but lucky for me ...

Some fools never learn
Play with the fire
And your gonna get burned
It's only love when your loved in return
Some fools never learn
Some fools never learn
Some fools never learn
