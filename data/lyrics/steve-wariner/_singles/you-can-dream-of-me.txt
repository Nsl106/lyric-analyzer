Well, I've heard it said
"The grass is always greener"
We want what we can't have or so it seems
When I looked at you
The world never looked any sweeter
And I go home to her and see you in my dreams

So if you want someone to fill your wakin' hours
With a love that is real, baby
I'm still not free
If you think you could fall for a telephone call
And some flowers
If you're dreamin' of someone
You can dream of me

When the stars are out
Sometimes I still can remember
The clear September night we first met
Through the fall
I never looked at another
Then the winter came how quickly we forget

So if you want someone to fill your wakin' hours
With a love that is real
Baby, I'm still not free

If you think you could fall for a telephone call
And some flowers
If you're dreamin' of someone
You can dream of me

Dream of me
I'll be dreamin' of you
I'll never forget how you told me
That your heart was taken too, you said

If you want someone to fill your wakin' hours
With a love that is real
Baby, I'm still not free

If you think you could fall for a telephone call
And some flowers
If you're dreamin' of someone
You can dream of me
I'll be dreaming of you, babe
You can dream of me
