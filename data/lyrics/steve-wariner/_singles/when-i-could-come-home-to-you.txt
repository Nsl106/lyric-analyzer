There's a light that I leave on
It's just an illusion 'cause
There's no one at home
It shines just like it used to
When I could come home to you
There's a song on the radio
I love to hear it 'cause you loved it so
It reminds me of the things we used to do
When I could come home to you
Guess, I'm just foolin' myself
I've always been a fool for you
I'm still livin' for the day
My dreams come true
When I can come home to you
Like the ring I still wear
My heart's still waiting
It'll always be here
Do you ever think about those days too?
When I could home to you
Yes, I'm just foolin' myself
I've always been a fool for you
I'm still livin' for the day
My dreams come true
When I can come home to you
There's a light that I leave on
It's just an illusion 'cause
There's no one at home
