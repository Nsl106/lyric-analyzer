[Verse 1]
A couple of days isn't a very long time
Why can't I just walk away
I used to be good at goodbye
But out on the water
Under the stars
I let the moonlight play a trick on my heart

[Chorus]
You had some fun for the weekend
But I'll be in love for the rest of my life
You took me out to the deep end
And I fell right over
I didn't think twice
I finally got something worth keepin'
And if I can't have you tonight
At least I had the weekend

[Verse 2]
The radio plays, the sound of the waves rollin' in
The smell of the night
Sure can get under your skin
Just for a moment
I held you too close
Now I'm all out of time, and I don't wanna let go

[Chorus]
You had some fun for the weekend
But I'll be in love for the rest of my life
You took me out to the deep end
And I fell right over
I didn't think twice
I finally got something worth keepin'
And if I can't have you tonight
At least I had the weekend

[Bridge]
How much can happen in a night or two?
I guess it's all depending on your point of view

[Chorus]
You had some fun for the weekend
But I'll be in love for the rest of my life
You took me out to the deep end
And I fell right over
I didn't think twice
I finally got something worth keepin'
And if I can't have you tonight
At least I had the weekend

[Outro]
You had some fun for the weekend
But I'll be in love for the rest of my life
You took me out to the deep end
And I fell right over
I didn't think twice...
