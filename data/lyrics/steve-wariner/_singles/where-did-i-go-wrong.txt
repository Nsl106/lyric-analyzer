When you told me that you loved me
I believed every single word you said
Then you showed me, that you didn't mean it
That you loved somebody else, instead
I know you've got a right to find someone new
Well, I've got a right to feel this way, too
Where did I go wrong? Where did he go right?
And now I'd won the battle if I'd known there was a fight
I can't stand the thought of never holding you tight
Where did I go wrong and he go right?
There was something all around us
Like I'd never felt before
Guess I should've seen it coming
I was busy comin' back for more
I know you've got a right to change your mind
Well, I got a right to be losing mine
Where did I go wrong? Where did he go right?
I know I'd won the battle if I'd known there was a fight
I can't stand the thought of never holding you tight
Where did I go wrong and he go right?
Where did I go wrong? Where did he go right?
I know I'd won the battle if I'd known there was a fight
I can't stand the thought of never holding you tight
Where did I go wrong and he go right?
Where did I go wrong? Tell me where did he go right?
Where did I go wrong? Tell me where did he go right?
Where did I go wrong? Tell me where did he go right?
