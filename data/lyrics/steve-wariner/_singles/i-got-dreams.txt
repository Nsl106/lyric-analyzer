Go ahead and break my heart, just see if I care
I ain't gonna fall apart girl, just 'cause you're not there
Even when the going starts to get a little rough
Gonna keep on trying hard, I'm never giving up
I got dreams to get me through the night
Say you don't love me, one of these days you might
I got dreams that keep me holding on
Till you come running back where you belong
When I think that things have got as bad as they can be
All I do is close my eyes and you're right here with me
Gonna take a lot of hurt to throw me off this track
I know everything will be alright when you come back
I got dreams to get me through the night
Say you don't love me, one of these days you might
I got dreams that keep me holding on
Till you come running back where you belong
Gonna take a lot of hurt to throw me off this track
I know everything will be alright when you come back
I got dreams to get me through this night
Say you don't love me, one of these days you might
I got dreams that keep me holding on
Till you come running back where you belong
I got dreams
I got dreams
I got dreams
