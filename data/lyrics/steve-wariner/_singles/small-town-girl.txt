Cold city like the eyes in the subway station
It's ten stories to my desk in the smoggy sky
But after five, I'm headed home to heaven
To an easy world
There ain't nothin like the love of a small town girl

Hot coffee and the sound of her sweet voice callin
Country station on the kitchen radio
That's how I know
There's still a little magic
In this crazy world...
There ain't nothin like the love of a small town girl

She makes love to me in real close two part harmony
She makes the city feel like walks in the cool country rain

No traffic and the sound of the street is quiet
Fifth avenue is dressed in a foot of snow
No where to go but underneath the covers
Lovers while the snowflakes swirl
There ain't nothin like the love of a small town girl
There ain't nothin like the love of a small town girl
