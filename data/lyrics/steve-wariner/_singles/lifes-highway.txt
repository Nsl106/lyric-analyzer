[Verse 1]
Sun is up, time's at hand
There's a stir across the land
And so begins another day
On life's highway

[Verse 2]
On city streets, down country roads
Like a stream the people flow
There's bread to win and tolls to pay
On life's highway

[Chorus]
There is hope with every turn
A bridge to build, a bridge to burn
Here's hoping you never go astray
On life's highway

[Verse 3]
We are young, then we're old
Passing through, then passing on
Like the roses bloom and fade
On life's highway

[Verse 4]
Step by step, 'round and 'round
Never knowing where we're bound
From the cradle to the grave
On life's highway

[Chorus]
There is hope with every turn
A bridge to build, a bridge to burn
Here's hoping you never go astray
On life's highway

[Tag]
Sun is up, time's at hand
There's a stir across the land
And so begins another day
On life's highway
