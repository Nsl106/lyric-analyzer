By now she's putting on her makeup
Bet she's been crying all night long
By now her heart is surely breaking
Just like this cold gray Georgia dawn
By now she knows how much she needs me
'Cause she can't make it on her own
By now she thinks I really miss her
But I've hardly noticed she was gone
And any minute now that phone is gonna ring
She'll say let's work it out somehow
But time keeps dragging on, what's taking her so long?
I should've heard from her by now
By now she's slipped into her night gown
She's letting down her soft brown hair
By now she needs someone to hold her
And I know she's wishing I was there
And any minute now that phone is gonna ring
And she'll say let's work it out somehow
But time keeps dragging on, what's taking her so long?
I should've heard from her by now
By now I know how much I love her
