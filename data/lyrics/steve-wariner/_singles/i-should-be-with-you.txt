I met a lady on the plane to California
She reminded me so much of you
When she asked what I was doin' here, well then it hit me
The crazy things a dollar makes us do
I should be with you right now
The state that you're in
I should holdin' you instead of losin' my mind
Just when you need me the most so does the coast
But I swear, I'll make it up to you this time
I pass a family as they hug before departure
It just reminds me you're alone
I hold the quarter that will take my voice back to you
And hear you say, "I need you here at home"
I should be with you there right now
The state that you're in
I should holdin' you instead of losin' my mind
Just when you need me the most so does the coast
But I swear, I'll make it up to you this time
I should be with you there right now
The state that you're in
I should holdin' you instead of losin' my mind
Just when you need me the most so does the coast
But I swear, I'll make it up to you this time
