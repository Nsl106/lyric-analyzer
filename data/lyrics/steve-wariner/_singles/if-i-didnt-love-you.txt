If I didn't Love You

I could be wild as a gypsy
Doin' just what I please
Back to the past and my thumb in the breeze
I might be free, but where would I be
If I didn't love you, If I didn't love you

I could row down a river and never come back
Ride on a rail 'til I run out of track
It wouldn't matter, that's a matter of fact
If I didn't love you, If I didn't love you

If I didn't love you, I'd never have found
These sweet ties that bind without weighin' me down
If I didn't love you, I'd have nothing to give
I'd spend a lifetime and never have lived
If I didn't love you, If I didn't love you

I could sail the high sea with my stern to the wind
A mind full of memories of the places I've been
I'd still be waitin' for my ship to come in
If I didn't love you, If I didn't love you

If I didn't love you, I'd never have found
These sweet ties that bind without weighin' me down
If I didn't love you, I'd have nothin' to give
I'd spend a lifetime and never have lived
If I didn't love you, If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you, If I didn't love you
(If I didn't love you), If I didn't love you
