I reached out my arms and I touched you
With soft words I whispered your name
I held your love on the tips of my fingers
But that was as close as I came
My eyes had a vision of sweet lips
Yielding beneath my command
I held you right on the tips of my fingers
But I let you slip right thru my hands
Yes I let you slip right thru my hands

Somebody took you when I wasn't looking
I should have known from the start
It's a long, long way from the tips of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart
To the love hidden deep in your heart

Somebody took you when I wasn't looking
I should have known from the start
It's a long, long way from the tips of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart
To the love hidden deep in your heart

I held your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let you slip right thru my hands
Yes I let you slip right thru my hands

I held your love on the tips of my fingers...
