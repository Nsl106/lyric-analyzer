Love the way you look in that dress
Um, you've got me thinkin' thoughts in my head
The way your body's movin' slowly to the music
Only leaves me wantin' more

So, baby, let's don't call it a night
Love the way you're holdin' me tight
When you're next to me there's no place I'd rather be
Everything is feeling so right
So, baby, let's don't call it a night

Just let that clock tick away
'Cause in the morning we can sleep in late
Right now, let's spend our time on what we've got in mind
I'll get up and close the door

Let's don't call it a night
Love the way you're holdin' me tight
When you're next to me, there's no place I'd rather be
Everything is feeling so right
Now, baby, let's don't call it a night

Well, baby's let's don't call it a night
Yeah, I love the way you're holdin' me, holdin' me tight
When you're next to me, there's no place I'd rather be
Everything is feeling so right
So, baby, let's don't call it, no, let's don't call it a night
No, no, no, no, no, no
