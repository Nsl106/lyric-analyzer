[Verse 1]
Ever since she was a baby
Sitting on her daddy's knee
Had him wrapped around her finger
Doing anything she pleased

[Verse 2]
She had a way of getting what she wanted
But Daddy knew in his mind
That pretty soon the boys would come running
It's just a matter of time before

[Chorus]
Hearts are gonna roll, heads are gonna turn
Tears are gonna fall, a bridge is gonna burn
Hearts are gonna roll, hearts are gonna roll

[Verse 3]
Now she changes like the weather
Never stays in love too long
She'll take you to the limit
Just to leave you hanging on

[Verse 4]
Drop dead looks and a mind for trouble
That's all the girl's ever known
Leaving behind a path of destruction
No matter where she goes

[Chorus]
Hearts are gonna roll, heads are gonna turn
Tears are gonna fall, a bridge is gonna burn
Hearts are gonna roll, hearts are gonna roll

[Bridge]
Don't fall under the spell of her eyes boy
She's not looking at you
Take it from somebody who knows
She's moving right on through

[Chorus]
Hearts are gonna roll, heads are gonna turn
Tears are gonna fall, a bridge is gonna burn
Hearts are gonna roll, hearts are gonna roll

[Verse 5]
Ever since she was a baby
Sitting on her daddy's knee
Had him wrapped around her finger
Doing anything she pleased, he knew

[Tag]
Hearts are gonna roll, hearts are gonna roll
Hearts are gonna roll, hearts are gonna roll
Watch 'em roll now
