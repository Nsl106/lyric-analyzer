[Verse 1]
She had a dead-end job at the National Bank
And a deadbeat husband who always drank
So when he didn't come home, she had the gin to thank
For the tears in her eyes
So Dixie packed up and said her goodbyes
And she went

[Chorus]
Driving so far away, nobody's gonna find her
Flying just fast enough to leave it all behind her
But she didn't know 'til she hit the road, deep in her soul
She's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
Ain't nothing stronger than the heart of Dixie
The heart of Dixie

[Verse 2]
It's a funny thing when your world falls down
It's got a way of showing you what you're all about
Now Dixie's got her wheels pointed south
And she ain't never looking back
And nobody knew she was brave like that
And she went

[Chorus]
Driving so far away, nobody's gonna find her
Flying just fast enough to leave it all behind her
But she didn't know 'til she hit the road, deep in her soul
She's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
Ain't nothing stronger than the heart of Dixie
The heart of Dixie

[Bridge]
Yeah, Dixie woke up to the truth one day
Grabbed her cheap sunglasses and her lipstick case
And she went

[Chorus]
Driving so far away, nobody's gonna find her
Flying just fast enough to leave it all behind her
But she didn't know 'til she hit the road deep in her soul
She's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
Ain't nothing stronger than the heart of Dixie
The heart of Dixie

[Outro]
Ooh
The heart of Dixie
Oh
