[Verse 1]
Usually see her with some sauvignon blanc in her glass
Sipping slow down, she ain't out tipping it back
But if you see her out tonight, she'll be flirting with Jack
Yeah, and I'm the only one to blame
Ain't the ninety-proof type, but tonight it'll work
Anything to numb the pain or to drown out the hurt
I tried to tell her 'bout my kind and, boy, did she learn
I just ain't the type of soul you save

[Pre-Chorus]
But she tried, and I did what I do best

[Chorus]
I took a good thing and I turned it into goodbye
Took the fire in her eyes, put it on ice
Turned that angel's world upside-down
Dipped her wings in Tennessee brown
I turned her calling me into calling me a mistake
Turned her heart of gold into a heartbreak
If I was her, I'd damn sure hate me
I turned her love into pain and her wine into whiskey

[Verse 2]
And she said
I was misunderstood, but I proved her wrong
I'm the same old me that I've been all along
Now she's looking for some peace in a bottle of strong
Me and Number 7 getting gone

[Chorus]
I took a good thing and I turned it into goodbye
Took the fire in her eyes, put it on ice
Turned that angel's world upside-down
Dipped her wings in Tennessee brown
I turned her calling me into calling me a mistake
Turned her heart of gold into a heartbreak
If I was her, I'd damn sure hate me
I turned her love into pain and her wine into whiskey

[Post-Chorus]
Wine into whiskey

[Bridge]
Yeah, she tried, and I did what I do best

[Chorus]
I took a good thing and I turned it into goodbye
Took the fire in her eyes, put it on ice
Turned that angel's world upside-down
Dipped her wings in Tennessee brown
I turned her calling me into calling me a mistake
Turned her heart of gold into a heartbreak
If I was her, I'd damn sure hate me
I turned her love into pain and her wine into whiskey
