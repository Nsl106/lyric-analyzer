[Verse 1]
Standin' on my step, kinda felt like freedom
Malibu one suitcase short of leavin'
You were the driver, I was the reason
There was mascara on your shirt
If I'da known where that left turn was leadin'
You'da seen me runnin' in a rearview
Like you tied my heart to your car
Turn the key in three, two

[Chorus]
One day you called me baby
These days it's only eighty
Proof you probably hate me
I don't blame you, I blame me
For them sunset taillights sinkin', tonight I'm just thinkin'
Three words, too late, damn girl
You're the one that got away

[Verse 2]
Countin' on a bottle to flood these memories
They're still floatin' and it's almost empty
Take the whiskey rain of this century to drown you out
Make you do a U-turn, if it was me it was up to
Girl, just like that, I'd take you back in three, two

[Chorus]
One day you called me baby
These days it's only eighty
Proof you probably hate me
I don't blame you, I blame me
For them sunset taillights sinkin', tonight I'm just thinkin'
Three words, too late, damn girl
You're the one that got away

[Bridge]
Yeah, in about three, two

[Chorus]
One, I'ma call you baby
Try to change your mind one-eighty
I know you probably hate me
I don't blame you, I blame me
For them sunset taillights sinkin'
Tonight I'm just thinkin'
Three words, too late, damn girl
You're the one that got away

[Outro]
Got away
