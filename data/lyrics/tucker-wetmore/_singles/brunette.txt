[Verse 1]
Lord knows I got a type
And there's a few in here tonight
Well, I've learned my lesson too many times
Blondes like you put me through hell and I need somethin' new

[Chorus]
I need a brown-eyed, 5'5
North side of the Mason-Dixon line
Kind ain't climbed up in a four-wheel drive that's lifted
Never been fishin', never been muddin'
Gotta be, gotta be one that don't remind me of you there beside me
I need to find me a brunette

[Verse 2]
One that don't smoke when she drinks
Or know them songs we used to sing
I'd rather be lonely when it's time to leave
At 2 a.m., go 'head out with some girl that ain't your opposite

[Chorus]
I need some brown-eyed, 5'5
North side of the Mason-Dixon line
Kind ain't climbed up in a four-wheel drive that's lifted
Never been fishin', never been muddin'
Gotta be, gotta be one that don't remind me of you there beside me
I need to find me a brunette

[Bridge]
When it comes to that next head on my chest
Won't be a bit of blonde on her head
You ruined that for me when you left
Since you left

[Chorus]
I need a brown-eyed, 5'5
North side of the Mason-Dixon line
Kind ain't climbed up in a four-wheel drive that's lifted
Never been fishin', never been muddin'
Gotta be, gotta be one that don't remind me of you there beside me
I need to find me a brunette
