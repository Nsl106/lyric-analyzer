[Verse 1]
We go out to a party somewhere
The moment we walk in the door
People stop and everybody stares
She don't know what they're starin' for

[Chorus]
She don't know she's beautiful (Never crossed her mind)
She don't know she's beautiful (No, she's not that kind)
She don't know she's beautiful
Though time and time I've told her so

[Verse 2]
There she goes just walking down the street
And someone lets a whistle out
A girl like her, she just can't see
What the fuss is all about

[Chorus]
And she don't know she's beautiful (Never crossed her mind)
She don't know she's beautiful (No, she's not that kind)
She don't know she's beautiful
Though time and time I've told her so

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Morning comes and her hair's all a mess
That's when she thinks she looks her worst
It's times like this she don't know why
I can't take my eyes off her

[Chorus]
'Cause she don't know she's beautiful (Never crossed her mind)
She don't know she's beautiful (No, she's not that kind)
She don't know she's beautiful
Though time and time I've told her...

[Chorus]
She don't know she's beautiful (Never crossed her mind)
She don't know she's beautiful (No, she's not that kind)
She don't know she's beautiful
Though time and time I've told her...

[Outro]
She don't know she's beautiful...
