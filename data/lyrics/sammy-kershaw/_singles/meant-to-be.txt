[Verse 1]
Well, first I missed my plane
So I wound up on your flight
Then we got stuck in Dallas-Ft. Worth half the night
And the only vacant seat
You could find at gate twenty-nine
Was one next to mine

[Chorus]
Call it fate, destiny
Call it luck you ended up with me
But some things are meant to be
Coincidence, circumstance
Or something bigger that's just out of our hands
Oh, some things are meant to be

[Verse 2]
You said Atlanta was your home
Well I happened to live there too
I'd just broken up with someone and so had you
And when you said for everyone
There is someone they're meant to find
I knew I'd found mine

[Chorus]
Call it fate, destiny
Call it luck you ended up with me
But some things are meant to be
Coincidence, circumstance
Or something bigger that's just out of our hands
Oh, some things are meant to be

[Refrain]
Coincidence, circumstance
Or something bigger that's just out of our hands
Oh, some things are meant to be
Baby, some things are meant to be
