[Verse 1]
You are the love of my life
And you are the reason I'm alive
And baby, baby, baby
When I think of how you saved me, I go crazy

[Verse 2]
I've never known love like this
And it fills me with a new tenderness
And I know, I know, I know
You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You're all I can't resist

[Pre-Chorus]
And I need to tell you
The first time I held you I knew
You are the love of my life

[Chorus]
I spent a lifetime waiting
Always hesitating until you
I was lost so deep inside my shell
'Til you came and saved me from myself
Now all I really know is I need you

[Verse 3]
You are the love of my life
All the joy and tears that I cry
And baby, baby, baby
You don't have to say a word
I see it in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
As we stand together
I promise forever 'til the day that I die
You are the love of my life

[Chorus]
I spent a lifetime waiting
Always hesitating until you
I was lost so deep inside my shell
'Til you came and saved me from myself
Now all I really know is I need you

[Outro]
You are the love of my life
And you are the reason I'm alive
