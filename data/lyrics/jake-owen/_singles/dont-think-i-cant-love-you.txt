[Verse 1]
I learned the hard way real early in life
That money sure don't grow on a tree
And there's a few things that a dollar can't buy
The best things in life, they come free

[Chorus]
So girl, I can't buy you a big diamond ring
No house on a hill full of life's finer things
And I'll tell you right now there's a whole lot that I just can't do
Ah baby, don't think I can't love you

[Verse 2]
And when I get home after working all day
I'm beat down, girl, I'm dead on my feet
But as tired as I am, if you wanna play
Well, playing sounds real good to me

[Chorus]
'Cause girl, I can't buy you a big diamond ring
No house on a hill full of life's finer things
And I'll tell you right now there's a whole lot that I just can't do
Ah baby, don't think I can't love you

[Outro]
So girl, I can't buy you a big diamond ring
No house on a hill full of life's finer things
And I'll tell you right now there's a whole lot that I just can't do
Ah baby, baby, ah baby, don't think I can't love you, oh, oh
