[Verse 1]
I work down at Ashbury Hill
Minimum wage, but it pays the bills
Cleaning floors and leading hymns on Sunday
Catherine Davis, room 3-0-3
Sweetest soul you ever could meet
I bring her morning coffee every day

[Chorus]
She calls me Raymond
She thinks I'm her son
Tells me get washed up for supper
'Fore your daddy gets home
She goes on about the weather
How she can't believe it's already 1943
And she calls me Raymond
And that's alright by me

[Verse 2]
She talks about clothes on the line, the summer air
Christmas morning and Thanksgiving prayer
And stories of a family that I never had
Well, sometimes I find myself wishing I'd been there

[Chorus]
When she calls me Raymond
She thinks I'm her son
Tells me get washed up for supper
'Fore your daddy gets home
She goes on about the weather
How she can't believe it's already 1943
And she calls me Raymond
And that's alright by me

[Bridge]
There's a small white cross in Arlington
Reads, "Raymond Davis, '71"
Until she can see his face again
I'm gonna fill in the best I can

[Chorus]
When she calls me Raymond
She thinks I'm her son
Tells me get washed up for supper
'Fore your daddy gets home
When she goes on about the weather
How she can't believe it's already 1943
She calls me Raymond
And that's alright by me

[Outro]
And she calls me Raymond
And that's alright by me
