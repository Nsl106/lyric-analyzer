I'm face to face with an angel
How'd you get those eyes so blue
You're a vision in white and I been waitin' all night
Just to have one dance with you now all my dreams are comin' true

I'm holdin' heaven in my arms tonight
Everything about you is so perfectly right
I've never been there but I think
I might be holdin' heaven in my arms tonight

I'm not sure where you came from
But I thank my lucky stars above
And I got the chance to have a dance
But one dance just ain't enough I think I'm fallin' in love

I'm holdin' heaven in my arms tonight
Everything about you is so perfectly right
I've never been there but I think
I might be holdin' heaven in my arms tonight

I'm holdin' heaven in my arms tonight
Everything about you is so perfectly right
I've never been there but I think
I might be holdin' heaven in my arms tonight

I'm holdin' heaven in my arms tonight...
