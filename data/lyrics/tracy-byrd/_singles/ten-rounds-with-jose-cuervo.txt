[Verse 1]
When I walked in the band just started
The singer couldn't carry a tune in a bucket
Was on a mission to drown her memory but
I thought no way with all this ruckus

[Chorus]
But after one round with Jose Cuervo
I caught my boots tappin' 'long with the beat
And after two rounds with Jose Cuervo
That band was sounding pretty darn good to me

[Verse 2]
Then some stranger asked me to dance
And I revealed to her my two left feet
Said, "Don't get me wrong I'm glad you asked
But tonight's about me and an ol' memory"

[Chorus]
Then after three rounds with Jose Cuervo
I let her lead me out on the floor
And after four rounds with Jose Cuervo
I was showin' off moves never seen before

[Bridge]
Well, around five or round six
I forgot what I came to forget
After round seven or was it eight
I bought a round for the whole dang place!

[Chorus]
After nine rounds with Jose Cuervo
They were countin' me out and I was about to give in
The after ten rounds with Jose Cuervo
I lost count and started countin' again!

[Outro]
One round with Jose Cuervo
I went two rounds with Jose Cuervo
Three rounds with Jose Cuervo
Five rounds with Jose Cuervo or was it four?
Six rounds with Jose Cuervo
Eight rounds with Jose Cuervo
Ten rounds with Jose Cuervo...
