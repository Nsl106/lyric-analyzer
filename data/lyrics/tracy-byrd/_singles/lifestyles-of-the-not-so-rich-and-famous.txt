[Verse 1]
Honey they're bringin' out a TV crew
They wanna do a story 'bout me and you
They'll be stringin' up bright lights in the backyard
There'll be cameras on their shoulders
We'll be readin' cue cards
Leave them long johns on the line
If the kids look dirty, that'll be just fine

[Chorus]
They're gonna put us on
Lifestyles of the not so rich and famous
They wanna see us go hog wild
Over beans and barbecue
They wanna see my Fairlane up on blocks
The holes in all our socks
Talkin' 'bout lifestyles of the not so rich and famous

[Verse 2]
Tell 'em 'bout your mama and the bowling league
Tell 'em 'bout junior and his baseball team
I'll show 'em my nine point buck on the wall
I'll blow a few times on my new duck call
Let 'em see ol' Blue how he sleeps all day
We'll bring out the Elvis TV trays

[Chorus]
They're gonna put us on
Lifestyles of the not so rich and famous
They wanna see us go hog wild
Over beans and barbecue
They wanna see my Fairlane up on blocks
The holes in all our socks
Talkin' 'bout lifestyles of the not so rich and famous

[Bridge]
Yeah, our idea of high class livin'
Is sittin' on the porch on a cool night
Our champagne and caviar
Is an RC cola and a moon pie

[Outro]
I'm talkin' 'bout lifestyles of the not so rich and famous
Lifestyles of the not so rich and famous
