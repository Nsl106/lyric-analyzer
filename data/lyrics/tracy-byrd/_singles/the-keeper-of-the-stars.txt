[Verse 1]
It was no accident me finding you
Someone had a hand in it
Long before we ever knew
Now I just can't believe you're in my life
Heaven's smiling down on me
As I look at you tonight

[Chorus]
I tip my hat to the keeper of the stars
He sure knew what He was doing
When He joined these two hearts
I hold everything when I hold you in my arms
I've got all I'll ever need
Thanks to the keeper of the stars

[Verse 2]
Soft moonlight on your face, oh, how you shine
It takes my breath away
Just to look into your eyes
I know I don't deserve a treasure like you
There really are no words to show my gratitude

[Chorus]
So, I tip my hat to the keeper of the stars
He sure knew what He was doing
When He joined these two hearts
I hold everything when I hold you in my arms
I've got all I'll ever need
Thanks to the keeper of the stars

[Outro]
It was no accident me finding you
Someone had a hand in it
Long before we ever knew
