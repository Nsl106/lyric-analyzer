[Verse 1]
Well it's Friday evening, six o'clock
And all my friends are twisting off
I'm at the house just turning on TV
Well they all wonder why I've changed
How many times must I explain
It's basic honky-tonk anatomy

[Chorus]
The drinkin' bone's connected to the party bone
The party bone's connected to the staying out all night long
And she won't think it's funny and I'll wind up all alone
And the lonely bone's connected to the drinkin' bone

[Verse 2]
Hey two plus two is always four
And down is south and up is north
And 32 degrees is freezing cold
You play with fire, you wind up burned
The early bird gets the worm
But the only thing you really need to know

[Chorus]
Is the drinkin' bone's connected to the party bone
The party bone's connected to the staying out all night long
And she won't think it's funny and I'll wind up all alone
And the lonely bone's connected to the drinkin' bone

[Bridge]
Yeah now sing it with me
Let's make sure you know

[Chorus]
The drinkin' bone's connected to the party bone
The party bone's connected to the staying out all night long
And she won't think it's funny and I'll wind up all alone
And the lonely bone's connected to the
Drinkin' bone's connected to the party bone
The party bone's connected to the staying out all night long
And she won't think it's funny and I'll wind up all alone
And the lonely bone's connected to the drinkin' bone
