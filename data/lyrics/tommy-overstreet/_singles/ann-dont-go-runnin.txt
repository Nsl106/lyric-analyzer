Ann, don't go running to him
He's not worth the tears you're crying, girl
Can't you see he's lying?
Ann, he'll only hurt you again

I can't stand to see you cry
I love you, Ann
I know he says the things a woman likes to hear
But when you really need his love it won't be there

My love is real
Not a game of pretend
I'll stay in love with you
And that's one place he's never been

Ann, please understand me
Ann
Ann, please understand me
Ann
Ann, don't go running to him

He's just a foolish dream you're chasing
Think of all the love you're wasting
Ann, there's no tomorrow with him
Don't believe him when he says he loves you

Ann, please try to understand
I want the best for you
I know my love can heal the hurt he's put you through
You've seen the rain
Now come walk in the sun
Let go of the past
What's done is done

Ann, please understand me
Ann
Ann, don't go running to him
Ann, don't go running to him
Ann, don't go running to him
Ann
