Gwen, congratulations
You took a man who was strong
And you made him do wrong tonight
Gwen, I fought temptation
But the fire in my soul
Burned out of control tonight

You were the spider
I was the fly
You weaved your web so well
I couldn't run
I've got a woman waiting at home

She believes in me
What have I done?
What have I done?
Gwen, how can I face her?
When I left you, Gwen
And I fell into sin tonight

You were the spider
I was the fly
You weaved your web so well
I couldn't run
I've got a woman waiting at home

She believes in me
What have I done?
What have I done?

Gwen, how can I face her?
When I left you, Gwen
And I fell into sin tonight
Gwen, congratulations
