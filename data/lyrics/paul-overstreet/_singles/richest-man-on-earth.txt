[Verse 1]
Well, I've heard tale of millionaires and billionaires and such
Who gathered all their treasures and still did not have enough
If money could buy peace of mind I guess they'd have it all
But all the money in the world won't hold you when you fall

[Chorus]
We've got a roof over our heads and the kids have all been fed
And the woman I love most lies close beside me in our bed
Lord give me the eyes to see exactly what it's worth
And I will be the richest man on earth

[Verse 2]
Lord, when I wished I had the things that you gave someone else
I pray that you'll forgive me for just thinking of myself
I haven't been as thankful as I know I ought to be
I should be more than satisfied with all you've given me

[Chorus]
We've got a roof over our heads and the kids have all been fed
And the woman I love most lies close beside me in our bed
Lord give me the eyes to see exactly what it's worth
And I will be the richest man on earth

[Bridge]
One thing is for certain, it don't matter when you die
If you had a million, or if you just got by

[Chorus]
We've got a roof over our heads and the kids have all been fed
And the woman I love most lies close beside me in our bed
Lord give me the eyes to see exactly what it's worth
And I will be the richest man on earth

Yes I will be the richest man on earth
