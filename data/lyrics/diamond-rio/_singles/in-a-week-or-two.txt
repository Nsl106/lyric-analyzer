[Verse 1]
In a week or two, I would have been ready
I would have known what to say
But I missed my chance when the words "I love you"
Came just a little too late

[Chorus]
In a week or two, I was gonna bring you diamonds
In a week or two, a long, long string of pearls
And we would've run down to the river at night
Sailed away, just me and you
In a week or two

[Verse 2]
A little more time was all I needed
But somehow fall became spring
But put off today what you can do tomorrow
Sometimes you don't do a thing

[Chorus]
In a week or two, I was gonna bring you diamonds
In a week or two, a long, long string of pearls
And we would've run down to the river at night
Sailed away, just me and you
In a week or two

[Bridge]
These words in my heart
Never had a chance to be heard
But I'm telling you now
For all that it's worth

[Chorus]
In a week or two, I was gonna bring you diamonds
In a week or two, a long, long string of pearls
And we would've run down to the river at night
Sailed away, just me and you
In a week or two
