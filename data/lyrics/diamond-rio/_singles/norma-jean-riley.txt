Wish I had I car
Top rolled down, music up loud
Follow that girl all over the town, you'll see
Norma Jean Riley's gonna notice me

Wish I had a dog
Seen her in the park, with a puppy on a string
Looking so cute, baby sooner or later we'll meet
Norma Jean Riley's gonna talk to me

[Chorus]
Everybody says fool, fool, nothing you can do
Never gonna see her with the likes of you
I say watch and see
Norma Jean Riley's gonna notice me

Ought to learn to dance
With the hottest moves and the latest styles
Get her on the dance floor and after a while you'll see
Norma Jean Riley's gonna dance with me

Everybody says fool, fool, nothing you can do
Never gonna see her with the likes of you
I say watch and see
Norma Jean Riley gonna notice me

Gonna write a song
Sing about her hair, her lips and her eyes
Bring her to tears with my heartfelt honesty
Norma Jean Riley's gonna fall for me

Everybody says fool, fool, nothing you can do
Never gonna see her with the likes of you
I say watch and see
Norma Jean Riley's gonna fall for me

Everybody says fool, fool, nothing you can do
Never gonna see her with the likes of you
I say watch and see
Oh, Norma Jean Riley's gonna marry me
