Mirror, Mirror, on my wall
Tell me, who is the loneliest fool of them all
No, wait a minute, I believe I see
The answer's staring back at me

Spent most of the morning laying in bed
Lunch was a black coffee and three cigarettes
They say it will kill me, but I've got a hunch
That this broken heart's gonna beat 'em to the punch

Mirror, Mirror, on my wall
Tell me, who is the loneliest fool of them all
No, wait a minute, I believe I see
The answer's staring back at me

Yes, I'm the one who swore she would stay
Right up to the moment the U-Haul drove away
She didn't leave a table; she didn't leave a chair
But she knew what she was doing
When she left you hanging there

Aw, Mirror, Mirror, on my wall
Tell me, who is the loneliest fool of all
No, wait a minute, I believe I see
The answer's staring back at me

No, wait a minute, I believe I see
The answer's staring back at me...
