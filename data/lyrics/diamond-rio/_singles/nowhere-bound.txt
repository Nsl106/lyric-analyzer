You save up your money boy, bought you some shoes
The highway's calling you and she's
Just when you thought you had it beat
But now you're leaving town on a one-way street

Chorus:
It's a hard, hard lesson
But you're gonna have to learn it
It's a long cold swim up against the current
And somewhere down the line
You're gonna have to turn it, around
'Cause boy right now you're nowhere bound

Her words still echo through your mind
But fade away as you cross the county line
Running from trouble or from the truth
It doesn't matter either way you lose

Chorus:
It's a hard, hard lesson
But you're gonna have to learn it
It's a long cold swim up against the current
And somewhere down the line
You're gonna have to turn it, around
'Cause boy right now you're nowhere bound

--- Instrumental ---

Well, you walk ten miles just to make new tracks
But you turn around and find that it's twenty miles back
And it's never gonna change it you keep leaving
Your heart's gonna break, but never break even

Where to now, do you know?
One thing's for certain
Gonna reap just what you sow
And all you planted was heartache and pain
Don't look now but it looks like rain

Chorus:
It's a hard, hard lesson
But you're gonna have to learn it
It's a long cold swim up against the current
And somewhere down the line
You're gonna have to turn it, around
'Cause boy right now you're nowhere bound

Nowhere bound

Nowhere bound...
