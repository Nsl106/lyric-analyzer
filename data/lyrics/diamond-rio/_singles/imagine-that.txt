What is the world coming to
Where lovers can't believe
They got love coming true
And then they up and leave

Say they will when they won't
Say I do, then they don't
That ain't the way its gotta be
With you and me

Imagine that, a love that lasts forever
Imagine that, for all the world to see
That two people stay together that way it outta be
Oh, imagine that

I don't intend to change the world
I couldn't if I tried
As long as I got you with me girl
I'll be satisfied

Let's do what we can, mean what we say
And we'll just take it day by day
'Cause I wanna prove to everyone
That it can be done

Imagine that, a love that lasts forever
Imagine that, for all the world to see
That two people stay together that way it outta be
Oh, imagine that

Do you believe in love enough to go the distance?
Do you believe in love enough to make a stand?
Do you believe enough to handle the resistance?
'Cause I believe we can

Imagine that, a love that lasts forever
Imagine that, for all the world to see
That two people stay together that way it outta be
Oh, imagine that
