[Verse 1]
I said, "Hello, I think I'm broken," and though I was only jokin'
It took me by surprise when you agreed
I was tryin' to be clever, but for the life of me I never
Would have guessed how far the simple truth would lead

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You knew all my lines, you knew all my tricks
You knew how to heal that pain no medicine can fix

[Chorus]
And I bless the day I met you, and I thank God that he let you
Lay beside me for a moment that lives on
And the good news is I'm better for the time we spent together
And the bad news is you're gone

[Verse 2]
Looking back it's still surprisin', I was sinking, you were risin'
With a look you caught me in mid-air
Now I know God has his reasons, but sometimes it's hard to see them
When I awake and find that you're not there

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You found hope in hopeless, you made crazy sane
You became the missing link that helped me to break my chains

[Chorus]
And I bless the day I met you, and I thank God that he let you
Lay beside me for a moment that lives on
And the good news is I'm better for the time we spent together
And the bad news is you're gone

[Outro]
The bad news is... you're gone
Hmm-hmm, oh-oh
Oh, you're gone
Oh-oh, you're gone
You're gone
