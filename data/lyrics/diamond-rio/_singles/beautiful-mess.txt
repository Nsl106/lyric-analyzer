[Verse 1]
Going out of my mind these days
Like I'm walking 'round in a haze
I can't think straight, I can't concentrate
And I need a shave

[Verse 2]
I go to work and I look tired
The boss man says, "Son you're gonna get fired
This ain't your style"
And from behind my coffee cup, I just smile

[Chorus]
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing else I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
'Cause I can't get enough
Can't stop the hunger for your love
What a beautiful, what a beautiful mess I'm in

[Verse 3]
This morning, put salt in my coffee
I put my shoes on the wrong feet
I'm losing my mind, I swear
It might be the death of me, but I don't care

[Chorus]
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing else I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
'Cause I can't get enough
Can't stop the hunger for your love
What a beautiful, what a beautiful mess I'm in

[Bridge]
Is it your eyes, is it your smile?
All I know is that you're driving me wild

[Chorus]
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing else I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
'Cause I can't get enough
Can't stop the hunger for your love
What a beautiful, what a beautiful

[Chorus]
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing else I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
'Cause I can't get enough
Can't stop the hunger for your love
What a beautiful, what a beautiful mess I'm in
