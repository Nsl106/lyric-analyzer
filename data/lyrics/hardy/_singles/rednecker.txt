[Verse 1]
Well so you think you've got some county line cred’
'Cause you rode a dirt road or two
You got a Mossy Oak hat on top of your head
And a southern pride tattoo
Yeah, you might'a drank a little grain alcohol
Or hauled a little hay
But if you think your boots got more dirt than mine
I got one thing to say

[Chorus]
My town’s smaller than your town
And I got a bigger buck and bass on my wall
I got a little more kick in my drawl, y'all
I got a little more spit in my chaw
And my truck's louder than your truck
And my collar's a little more blue
You might think that you're redneck
But I'm rednecker than you, yes I am

[Verse 2]
I got a car parked in my front yard
With a floorboard full of Slim Jims
I piss where I want to
And I fish where I swim
Yeah, I bet you ain't got it on a tailgate
Or killed a copperhead a time or two
Man, if you're thinking you’re a better beer drinker
Buddy, I’ve got news for you

[Chorus]
My town's smaller than your town
And I got a bigger buck and bass on my wall
I got a little more kick in my drawl, y’all
I got a little more spit in my chaw
And my truck's louder than your truck
And my tick hound's a little more blue
You might think that you're redneck
But I’m rednecker than you, I'm rednecker than you (Woo!)

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'm down with the sound of a dixie whistle
Raising hell, praising Dale twelve in at Bristol
More sweat on my brow at the end of the day
So needless to say

[Chorus]
My town's smaller than your town
I got a bigger buck and bass on my wall
And I ain't tryin' to talk no smack
It's just the facts y'all
'Cause my truck's louder than your truck
And my red white's a little more blue (Damn right!)
You might think that you're redneck
But I'm rednecker than you, I'm rednecker than you
