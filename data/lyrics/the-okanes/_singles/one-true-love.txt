One true love
I want one true love

Someone that I can count on bein' there
Someone who really cares
Someone who really cares
Someone that I can really hold on to

One true love
I want one true love

I've got a loneliness inside of me
I need to share my dreams
I need to share my dreams
I need somebody I can walk through life, yeah

One true love

All I want is one true love
I want one true love

Don't wanna put my love out on the road
In places I don't know
I rather be alone
I need somebody I can come home to

One true love
I want one true love
I want one true love
