It was like nails on a chalkboard when Daddy played his kinda music
If you'd have asked me then, I'd a said it was borderline abusive
But I'm gettin' to where I don't mind it now
I'm comin' around

I blew out of here the next day after graduation
Destination: anywhere with a higher population
Never to return to this tiny town
But I'm comin' around

I'm comin' around, I'm figurin' out
A lot of things I thought I knew
I never deamed I'd be seein' things
From this point of view
Still a little ways from slowin' it all the way down
But I'm comin' around

I'm comin' around, I'm figurin' out
A lot of things I thought I knew
I never deamed I'd be seein' things
From this point of view
Still a little ways from slowin' it all the way down
But I'm comin' around

I've never been that big of gettin' up on Sunday mornin'
And listen to that ol' preacher talk was always kinda borin'
I'm still a little more lost than I am found
But I'm comin' around

Yeah, I'm comin' around

I'm comin' around, I'm figurin' out
A lot of things I thought I knew
I never deamed I'd be seein' things
From this point of view
Still a little ways from slowin' it all the way down
But I'm comin' around

Yeah, I'm comin' around
