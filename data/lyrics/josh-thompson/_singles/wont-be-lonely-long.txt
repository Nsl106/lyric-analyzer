When the lonely set in, I fought back the tears
I don't love you anymore is so hard to hear
It felt like a mile from our door to my truck
Somehow I found the strength to fire it up

How lucky am I you said goodbye
At seven o'clock on a Friday night

I won't be lonely long
By the time that first beer is gone
I'll be floatin' on a neon cloud with my friends around
We'll be raising up our glasses and singing out loud

To those done me wrong, drinkin' songs
Hey ladies, tonight it's on
No, I won't be lonely long

Well, I usually ain't much on dancin', but tonight I'm cuttin' up a rug
I get to say no ma'am when the ladies ask if I'm with anyone
When I'm tippin' the band and buyin' everybody shots
Spendin' every dollar I got

I won't be lonely long
By the time that first beer is gone
I'll be floatin' on a neon cloud with my friends around
We'll be raising up our glasses and singing out loud

To those done me wrong, drinkin' songs
Hey ladies, tonight it's on
No, I won't be lonely long

There ain't an empty space in this parkin' lot
Look at all the friends I got

I won't be lonely long
By the time that first beer is gone
I'll be floatin' on a neon cloud with my friends around
We'll be raising up our glasses and singing out loud

To those done me wrong, drinkin' songs
Hey ladies, tonight it's on
No, I won't be lonely long
