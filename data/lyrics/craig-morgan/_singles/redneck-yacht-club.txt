[Verse 1]
I'm meetin' my buddies out on the lake
We're headed out to a special place we love
That just a few folks know
There's no signin' up, no monthly dues
Take your Johnson, your Mercury
Or your Evinrude, an' fire it up
Meet us out at Party Cove

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on in, the water's fine
Just idle on over and toss us a line

[Chorus]
Bass-trackers, Bayliners, and a party barge
Strung together like a floatin' trailer park
Uh, anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long
Side by side, there's five houseboat front porches
Astroturf, lawn chairs, and tiki torches
Regular Joes rockin' the boat, that's us
The Redneck Yacht Club

[Verse 2]
Bermuda's, flip-flops, and a tank-top tan
He popped his first top at 10 a.m., that's Bob
He's our president
We're checkin' out the girls on the upper deck
Rubbin' in the 15 SPF, it's hot
Everybody's jumpin' in
Later on when the sun goes down
We'll pull out the jar and that old guitar
An' pass 'em around

[Chorus]
Bass-trackers, Bayliners, and a party barge
Strung together like a floatin' trailer park
Uh, anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long
Side by side, there's five houseboat front porches
Astroturf, lawn chairs, and tiki torches
Regular Joes rockin' the boat, that's us
The Redneck Yacht Club

[Bridge]
Uh, when the party's over and we're all alone
We'll be makin' waves in a no-wake zone

[Chorus]
Bass-trackers, Bayliners, and a party barge
Strung together like a floatin' trailer park
Uh, anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long
Side by side, there's five houseboat front porches
Astroturf, lawn chairs, and tiki torches
Regular Joes rockin' the boat, that's us
The Redneck Yacht Club

[Outro]
The Redneck Yacht Club
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
The Redneck Yacht Club
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
