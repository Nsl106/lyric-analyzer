[Verse 1]
Uh, you can see it from the river
To the top of White Pine Ridge
Burnin' like a summer sun
A bunch of rednecks getting half lit
There's mud-covered trucks and SUVs
Cranking up Hank and AC/DC

[Chorus]
At the bonfire, out in the sticks
Country backwoods, homegrown hicks
Bonfire, dance a little jig
Hold up your cup and take another swig
I won't sleep til dawn gonna party right down to the wire
At the bonfire

[Verse 2]
Everybody seen the headlights
When ole Sheriff John pulled up
We all got a little nervous
It's too late to hide our cups
He pops a top and holler real loud
Don't worry y'all, I came to hang out

[Chorus]
At the bonfire, out in the sticks
Country backwoods, homegrown hicks
Bonfire, dance a little jig
Hold up your cup and take another swig
I won't sleep til dawn gonna party right down to the wire
At the bonfire

[Bridge]
You dont have to be from around here to know right where to go
All you gotta do is load up and head towards the glow

[Chorus]
At the bonfire, out in the sticks
Country backwoods (Bonfire), homegrown hicks
Bonfire, dance a little jig
Hold up your cup and take another swig
At the bonfire, out in the sticks
Country backwoods, homegrown hicks
Bonfire, dance a little jig
Hold up your cup and take another swig
I won't sleep til dawn gonna party right down to the wire
At the bonfire
We're all hangin' at the bonfire
