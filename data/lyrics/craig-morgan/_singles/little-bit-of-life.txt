[Verse 1]
A little bit of guitar, a little bit of truck
A little bit of hound dog and a little bit of luck
A little bit of bacon, a little bit of beans
A little bit of you lovin' up on me
A little bit of how it supposed to be, a little bit of life

[Verse 2]
A little bit of backseat, a little bit of moon
A little bit of radio a-goin', "Boom, boom, boom"
A little bit of sugar, a little bit of spice
A little bit of nasty, a little bit of nice
A little bit of how it supposed to be, a little bit of life

[Chorus]
I breathe in, I breathe out
Yeah, sleepin' all night with the windows down
Up in the mornin', stirrin' around
Drink a pot of coffee and I head off to town
Work, work, work all day long
Crank it up, bag it up, bring it on home
Supper on the table and I eat me a bite
Then we snuggle on the porch by the pale moonlight
A little bit of me and you doin' alright, a little bit of life

[Verse 3]
A little bit of tractor, a little bit of farm
A little bit of cornfield and a little bit of barn
A little bit of come on, a little bit of play
A little bit of yee-haw in the hay
A Dixie cup, a homemade wine, a little bit of life

[Chorus]
I breathe in, I breathe out
Yeah, sleepin' all night with the windows down
Up in the mornin', stirrin' around
Drink a pot of coffee and I head off to town
Work, work, work all day long
Crank it up, bag it up, bring it on home
Supper on the table and I eat me a bite
Then we snuggle on the porch by the pale moonlight
A little bit of me and you doin' alright, a little bit of life

[Verse 4]
A little bit of back porch, a little bit of swing
A little bit of wind chimes a-goin, "Ding-a-ling"
A little bit of TV, a little bit of couch
Popcorn smellin' up the house
À la mode on a little slice of homemade pie, a little bit of life

[Chorus]
I breathe in, I breathe out
Yeah, sleepin' all night with the windows down
Up in the mornin', stirrin' around
Drink a pot of coffee and I head off to town
Work, work, work all day long
Crank it up, bag it up, bring it on home
Supper on the table and I eat me a bite
Then we snuggle on the porch by the pale moonlight
A little bit of me and you doin' alright, a little bit of life
A little bit of me and you doin' alright, a little bit of life

[Outro]
Yeah, a little bit of life
A little bit of guitar, a little bit of truck
A little bit of hound dog, a little bit of luck
A little bit of backseat, a little bit of moon
A little bit of radio, boom, boom, boom
A little bit of bacon, a little bit of beans
A little bit of you lovin' up on me
A little bit of come on, a little bit of play
A little bit of yee-haw in the hay
