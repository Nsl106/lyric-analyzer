[Verse 1]
My friends call me up 'cause they know I'm down
Take me out to paint the town and help me get over it
Pretty blonde girl at the end of the bar
Buys a drink, gives a wink, and then it goes too far
We're out on the dance floor, feelin' the gin
I finally start comin' alive again
I take her home for the night and everything is right
Until the first ray of sunlight

[Chorus]
Damn, if I don't wake up lovin' you
Oh, I wake up lovin' you

[Verse 2]
Thought if I could catch a plane, touch down out of town
Somewhere nobody knows you
Maybe I could give myself half of a chance
To get a life and act a like a different man
But my best of intentions were all shot to hell
And I found myself hidin' in a cheap hotel
Drownin' in the whiskey, starin' at the TV, tryin' not to sleep

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just gonna wake up lovin' you
Yeah, I wake up lovin' you, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, I wake up lovin' you, yeah
Yeah, I wake up lovin' you

[Bridge]
Remember when I told you I was never gonna stop
Lovin' you with all my heart and soul no matter what
Now it seems I'm breakin' every promise that I made
'Cause every night, I'm desperate
Askin' God if He would just let me forget it
But I wake up lovin' you
I wake up lovin' you

[Chorus]
I wake up lovin' you, yeah
I wake up lovin' you, yeah
I wake up lovin' you, oh (I wake up, oh)
I wake up lovin' you

[Outro]
I wake up lovin' you (I wake up love, oh)
I wake up lovin' you (Lovin' you)
