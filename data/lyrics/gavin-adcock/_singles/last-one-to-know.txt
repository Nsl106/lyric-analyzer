[Verse 1]
My buddy called and said, "I lost a couple screws
Been tryna tighten them up, but they keep coming loose"
Yeah, it's a wonder that I didn't see the light
For a lawman didn't tackle me, read me my rights

[Chorus]
Wild-ass women, hard-ass living
Did it to myself, near over and over
Guess me and my buddy Jim put on a hell of a show
They woke me up this morning, I was the last one to know

[Verse 2]
Took me a break from burning up the road
Tried to do some reacquainting with a girl I used to know
Yeah, she went and found another coat to ride
Put me on a late-night whiskey bar stool, smile or die

[Chorus]
Wild-ass women, hard-ass living
Did it to myself, near over and over
Guess me and my buddy Jim put on a hell of a show
They woke me up this morning, I was the last one to know

[Bridge]
Yes, I should know by now
That's how it goes when I go out

[Chorus]
Wild-ass women, hard-ass living
Did it to myself, near over and over
Guess me and my buddy Jim put on a hell of a show
They woke me up this morning, I was the last one to know

[Outro]
Yes, I should know by now
That's how it goes when I go out
That's how it goes when I go out
