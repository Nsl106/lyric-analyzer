[Verse 1]
If regrets were like raindrops
There'd be a river running through this house
If our love was like a circus
I'd be the sad-faced clown
Walking with my head down
Wondering where you are now

[Chorus]
Oh, didn't I wrap my arms around you
Stare in your eyes and swear I loved you?
Didn't I?
Baby, didn't I
Give you everything you ever wanted?
Love you like crazy, let's be honest
Didn't I?
Baby, didn't I? Didn't I?

[Verse 2]
I thought we were like a stone wall
Solid all the way around
I never knew you'd be the wrecking ball
To bring us tumbling down
'Til I woke up that Friday morning
To find you gone, you were gone

[Chorus]
Oh, didn't I wrap my arms around you
Stare in your eyes and swear I loved you?
Didn't I?
Baby, didn't I
Give you everything you ever wanted?
Love you like crazy, let's be honest
Didn't I?
Baby, didn't I? Didn't I?

[Refrain]
Didn't I wrap my arms around you
Stare in your eyes and swear I loved you?
Oh, baby, didn't I
Give you everything you ever wanted?
Love you like crazy, let's be honest
Didn't I?
Baby, didn't I? Didn't I?
Baby, didn't I?

[Outro]
Oh, baby, didn't I?
