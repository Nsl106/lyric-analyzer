Talk to me, talk to me
Darling, I love the things you say
Talk to me, talk to me
In your own sweet gentle way

Let me hear, tell me dear
Tell me you, you love me so
Talk to me, talk to me
Tell me what I want to know

The many ways you speak of love
I've heard before, it sounds so good everytime
Please say the one part, I love just once more
Darling I'm so glad you're mine

Talk to me, talk to me
Hold me close, whisper low
Talk to me, Darling can't you see
Baby I, I love you so

The many ways you speak of love
I've heard before, it sounds so good everytime
Please say the one part, I love just once more
Darling I'm so glad you're mine

Talk to me, talk to me
Hold me close, whisper low
Talk to me, Darling can't you see
Baby I, I love you so

Talk to me, talk to me
Darling I, I love you so

Yes, I do honey...
