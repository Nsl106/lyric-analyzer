Faded pictures
Yellow from time
Well worn memories of days gone by
Needing someone and nobody's there
These are the things broken dreams are made of
Lord, they're everywhere

Oh, the tears of the lonely
Keep falling all the time
Oh, tears of the lonely
They never dry

Another nightime that just never ends
A helpless longing for what might have been
Another morning to face all alone
These are the things broken dreams are made of
They go on and on

Oh, the tears of the lonely
Keep falling all the time
Oh, tears of the lonely
They never dry

Oh, the Tears of the lonely
Keep falling all the time
Oh, the tears of the lonely
They never dry...
