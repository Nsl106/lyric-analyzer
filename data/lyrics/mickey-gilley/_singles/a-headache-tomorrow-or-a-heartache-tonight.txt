Well, if the whiskey doesn't get me
I know the memories will
Cause you left a hole in my heart that's too deep to fill
But a drink or two
Maybe three or four
For a while you're out of sight
It's a headache tomorrow or a heartache tonight

The sun goes down
The blues come around
And the choice is black and white
Low down and lonesome and high as a kite
When you can't win for losing
You know it's just not right
It's a headache tomorrow or a heartache tonight

No matter which one you choose you lose
I know which one I'll take
When the sun comes up tomorrow
Something's gonna ache

If I could take a pill to kill the pain
I know I'm gonna be all right
It's a headache tomorrow or a heartache tonight

The sun goes down
The blues come around
And the choice is black and white
Low down and lonesome and high as a kite
When you can't win for losing
You know it's just not right
It's a headache tomorrow or a heartache tonight

The sun goes down
The blues come around
And the choice is black and white
Low down and lonesome and high as a kite
When you can't win for losing
You know it's just not right
It's a headache tomorrow or a heartache tonight
