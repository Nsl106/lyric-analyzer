I've been living a new way
Of life I love so
I can see the clouds are gath'ring
And the storm will wreck our home
Last night he held you tightly
And you didn't even shove
This is true for I've been watching
From the window up above

You must have thought that I was sleeping
Oh, I wish that I had been
But it's best I get to know you
And the way your heart can sin
I thought we belonged together
And our hearts fit like a glove
I was wrong for I was watching
From the window up above

From my eyes the teardrops started
As I listened on and on
I heard you whisper to him softly
That our marriage was all wrong
Well, I hope he makes you happy
And you never lose his love
I lost mine while I was watching
From the window up above

I lost mine while I was watching
From the window up above...
