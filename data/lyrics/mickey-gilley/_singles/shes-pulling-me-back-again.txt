She's pulling me back again
Darling, don't let her win
Take me in your arms, right now
Hold me tight

She's standing outside again
She's wanting to come back in
So if you've ever loved
Love me tonight

I can feel her reaching
In the night
So lay a little closer
By my side

Let me take my weakness
And love it out on you
Right now, I need your love
To hold on to

She's pulling me back again
Darling, don't let her win
Take me in your arms, right now
Hold me tight

She's standing outside again
Wanting to come back in
So if you've ever loved
Love me tonight

She's pulling me back again
