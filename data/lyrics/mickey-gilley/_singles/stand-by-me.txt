[Verse 1]
When the night has come and the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand by me

[Chorus]
Darling, stand by me
Won't you stand by me
If you're in need
Won't you stand, stand by me

[Verse 2]
And if the sky we look upon
Should ever crumble and fall
And the mountains should fall to the sea
No I won't be afraid, no I won't shed a tear
Just as long, just as long as you stand by me

[Chorus]
Darling, stand by me
Won't you stand by me
If you're in need
Won't you stand, stand by me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Darling, stand by me
Won't you stand by me
If you're in need
Won't you stand by me
