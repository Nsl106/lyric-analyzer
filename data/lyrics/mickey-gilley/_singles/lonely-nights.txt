[Verse 1]
Pardon me, I don't mean to waste your time
I just need someone to talk to if you don't mind?
Then I fought of loneliness
That tonight I guess I'm to just to weak to fight

[Refrain]
I can take the lonely days but I can't take these lonely nights

[Verse 2]
Are you alone? Tell me what's your name?
I just need someone to lean on, I'm not playing any games
So sit down here beside me
And let me buy you a glass of red rose wine

[Refrain]
I can take the lonely days but I can't take these lonely night

[Bridge]
When I thought that I was strong
But the night can be so long when you need a friend
But maybe we could find a little piece of mind
Before the morning comes again

[Verse 3]
So pardon me, if it seems I'm holdin' on
Letting go, it just isn't easy when your sleeping all alone
So let's forget about tomorrow, beg, steal or borrow
Hmm, just a little time

[Refrain]
I can take the lonely days but I can't take these lonely nights
Yes, I can take the lonely days but I can't take these lonely nights
