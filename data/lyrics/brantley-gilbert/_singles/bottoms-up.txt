[Verse 1]
I see you and me riding like Bonnie and Clyde
Going 95, burning down 129, yeah
Looking for the law, while I push my luck
She's riding shotgun like it ain't no thing
Turn the radio up so the girl can sing, right
Pull into the party like "Y'all wassup?"

[Chorus]
Tonight is bottoms up, up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet, little country town, get up
Drop a tailgate on your truck
Find a keg and fill your cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama looking at you like that
Make you wanna slide on in like "Girl, what's up?"

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, tonight is bottoms up (Up, up)
Get 'em up
Tonight is bottoms up (Up, up)
Get 'em up

[Verse 2]
Damn, girl, I gotta tip my hat
Never thought a country song would make you move like that, yeah
And she's doing it in Daisy Dukes, girl
She's got you tapping on your boy's shoulder
"Hey dog, check this out"
And that's how them girls do it in the Dirty South, yeah
She'll have you on your knee "Can I marry you?"
Yeah

[Chorus]
Tonight is bottoms up, up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet, little country town, get up
Drop a tailgate on your truck
Find a keg and fill your cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama looking at you like that
Make you wanna slide on in like "Girl, what's up?"

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, tonight is bottoms up (Up, up)
Get 'em up
Tonight is bottoms up (Up, up)
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up
Get 'em up
Get 'em up

[Break]
Hey y'all whatever ya sippin on get it up in the air one time
Bottoms up

[Bridge]
Let's give a toast to the good times
All y’all get your drinks up high
Everybody feeling alright
Damn right
'Cause

[Chorus]
Tonight is bottoms up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet, little country town, get up
Drop a tailgate on your truck
Find a keg and fill your cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama looking at you like that
Make yo wanna slide on in like "Girl, what's up?"
Tonight is bottoms up, up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet, little country town, get up
Drop a tailgate on your truck
Find a keg and fill your cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama looking at you like that
Make yo wanna slide on in like "Girl, what's up?"

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, tonight is bottoms up (Up, up)
Get 'em up
Tonight is bottoms up (Up, up)
Get 'em up (Get 'em up, get 'em up)
