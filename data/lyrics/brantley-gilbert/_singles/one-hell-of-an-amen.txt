[Verse 1]
Preacher said he died too young
Over there totin' that gun
For Uncle Sam and our freedom
Mom and Daddy dressed in black
They folded up that flag
Handed it to dad
And started prayin'
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, he went out
Twenty-one guns blazin'

[Chorus]
That's one hell of an Amen
That's the only way to go
Fightin' the good fight
'Til the good Lord calls you home
So, be well, my friend
'Til I see you again
This is our last goodbye
But it's a hell of an Amen

[Verse 2]
Doctor said he ain't got long
He just smiled and said bring it on
Well, if you think I'm scared
You got me all wrong, naw
A little cancer can't break me
My heart's right and I believe
We all hit our knees
And started prayin'

[Pre-Chorus]
No, and he never gave up
Just said, "The Good Lord's waiting"

[Chorus]
That's one hell of an Amen
That's the only way to go
Fightin' the good fight
'Til the good Lord calls you home
So, be well, my friend
'Til I see you again
This is our last goodbye
It's a hell of an Amen

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
So be well my friend
'Til I see you again
This is our last goodbye
But it's a hell of an Amen
Amen
It's a hell of an Amen
