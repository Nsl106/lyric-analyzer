[Verse 1]
Tell me what I have to do tonight
'Cause I'd do anything to make it right
Let's be us again
I'm sorry for the way I lost my head
I don't know why I said the things I said
Let's be us again

[Chorus]
Here I stand
With everything to lose
And all I know is I don't want to ever see the end
Baby please, I'm reaching out for you
Won't you open up your heart and let me come back in
Let's be us again
Oh us again

[Verse 2]
Look at me, I'm way past pride
Isn't there some way that we can try
To be us again
And even if it takes a while
I'll wait right here until I see that smile
That says we're us again

[Chorus]
Here I stand
With everything to lose
And all I know is I don't want to ever see the end
Baby please, I'm reaching out for you
Won't you open up your heart and let me come back in
Let's be us

[Bridge]
Baby baby what would I do
I can't imagine life without you

[Chorus]
Here I stand
With everything to lose
And all I know is I don't want to ever see the end
Baby please, I'm reaching out for you
Won't you open up your heart and let me come back in
Oh, here I am
I'm reaching out for you
So won't you open up your heart and let me come back in
Let's be us again
Oh let's be us again
