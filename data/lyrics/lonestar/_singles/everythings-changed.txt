[Verse 1]
Funny you should show up after all of these years
Yeah, things sure have changed around here
Seen a lot of strangers since they put that interstate through
No this ain't the same town that we once knew

[Chorus]
They put up a plant where we used to park
That ol' drive-in's a new Walmart
The cafe is closed where our names were carved on that corner booth
Yeah, everything's changed except for the way I feel about you

[Verse 2]
That westbound to Santa Fe don't stop here anymore
You were one of the last to get on board
That street that we grew up on you wouldn't recognize
Girl, nothin' been the same since you said good-bye

[Chorus]
They put up a plant where we used to park
That ol' drive-in's a new Walmart
The cafe is closed where our names were carved on that corner booth
Yeah, everything's changed except for the way I feel about you

They put up a plant where we used to park
That ol' drive-in's a new Walmart
The cafe is closed where our names were carved on that corner booth
Yeah, everything's changed except for the way I feel about you
Yeah, everything's changed except for the way I feel about you
