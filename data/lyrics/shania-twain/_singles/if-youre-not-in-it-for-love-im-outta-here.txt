[Intro]
Three, four, five

[Verse 1]
Mind if I sit down?
Can I buy you a round?
Haven't seen your face before
Are you new in town?
It's the same old line
Oh every time
Are you here alone?
Can I take you home?

[Verse 2]
Now every woman sees
With every "pretty please"
There's a pair of lying eyes
And a set of keys
He says, "come be a star" (Ooh)
In the back seat of my car
Oh, but baby, slow down
You're going way too far

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me make it clear
To you, my dear, yeah
[Handclaps]

[Chorus]
If you're not in it for love
If you're not willing to give it all you got
If you're not in it for life
If you're not in it for love
Let me make it clear to you, my dear
[Handclaps]
You're not in it for love
I'm outta here

[Verse 3]
Babe, I can change your world
Make you a cover girl
Yeah, you could be a beauty queen in a magazine
Now tell me, what's your sign? (Ooh)
Why always the same old line?
I'll be in number 409
If you change your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me make it clear
To you, my dear
[Handclaps]

[Chorus]
If you're not in it for love
If you're not willing to give it all you got
If you're not in it for life
If you're not in it for love
Let me make it clear to you, my dear
[Handclaps]
You're not in it for love
I'm outta here

[Outro]
If you're not in it for love, baby
Willing to give it all you got
Oh, if you're not in it for life
If you're not in it for love
If you're not in it for life
If you're not in it for love
I'm outta here
[Footsteps]
