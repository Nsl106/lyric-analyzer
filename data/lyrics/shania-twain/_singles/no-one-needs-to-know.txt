[Verse 1]
Am I dreaming or stupid?
I think I've been hit by cupid
But no one needs to know right now
I met a tall, dark and handsome man
And I've been busy making big plans
But no one needs to know right now
I got my heart set, my feet wet
But he don't even know it yet
And no one needs to know right now

[Chorus]
I'll tell him someday, some way, somehow
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now

[Verse 2]
I want bells to ring, a choir to sing
The white dress, the guests, the cake, the car, the whole darn thing
But no one needs to know right now

[Chorus]
I'll tell him someday, some way, somehow
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now

[Verse 3]
We'll have a little girl, a little boy
A little Benji we call Leroy
But no one needs to know right now

[Bridge]
And I'm not lonely anymore at night
And he don't know only, only he can make it right
And I'm not lonely anymore at night
And he don't know only, only he can make it right

[Outro]
I'm not dreaming or stupid
But boy, have I been hit by cupid
But no one needs to know right now
No one needs to know right now
No one needs to know right now

[Spoken Outro]
There's your record Hoggs
