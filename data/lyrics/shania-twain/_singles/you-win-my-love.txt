[Intro]
Come on

[Verse 1]
I'm lookin' for a lover who can rev his little engine up
He can have a '55 Chevy or a fancy little pick-up truck
If he's got a cool Cadillac with a jacuzzi in the back, I'm in, oh yeah
'Cause I'm a classy little chassis who's a-huntin' for a heart to win

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but if you wanna win it
There's no speed limit
Just go faster, faster, don't be slow
Rev it up, rev it up 'til your engine blows

[Chorus]
You win my love
You win my soul
You win my heart
Yeah, you get it all
You win my love
You make my motor run
You win my love
Yeah, you're number one

[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm a crazy little chassis
Yeah, the kind you just can't slow down
Oh no
I need a '65 cylinder, racy, little run around town

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but if you wanna win it
Babe, there's no speed limit
Just go faster, faster, don't be slow
Rev it up, rev it up 'til your engine blows

[Chorus]
You win my love
You win my soul
You win my heart
Yeah, you get it all
You win my love
You make my motor run
You win my love
Yeah, you're number one
Oh, uh-oh, yeah

[Bridge]
I want a heartbreak Harley
A full of steam dream machine
Or just a little late night sexy long stretch limousine

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but if you wanna win it
Babe, there's no speed limit
Just go faster, faster, don't be slow
Rev it up, rev it up 'til your engine blows

[Chorus]
You win my love
You win my soul
You win my heart
Yeah, you get it all
You win my love
You make my motor run
You win my love
Yeah, you're number one

[Outro]
Oh, you win my love
You win my love
Oh, you win my love
You win my love
I said you win my love
You win my love
Babe, you win my love
I said you win my love
Yeah, you win my love
You win my love
