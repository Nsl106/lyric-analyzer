[Intro]
(Oh na, na, na, na, na)

[Verse 1]
She hosts a TV show
She rides the rodeo
She plays the bass in a band
She's an astronaut
A valet at the parking lot
A farmer working the land
She is a champion
She gets the gold
She's a ballerina
The star of the show

[Chorus]
She's not just a pretty face
She's got everything it takes

[Verse 2]
She has a fashion line
A journalist for "TIME"
Coaches a football team
She's a geologist
A romance novelist
She is a mother of three
She is a soldier
She is a wife
She is a surgeon
She'll save your life

[Chorus]
She's not just a pretty face
She's got everything it takes
She's mother of the human race
She's not just a pretty face

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, yeah
Oh, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na

[Verse 3]
She is your waitress
She is your judge
She is your teacher
She is every woman in the world
Oh, la, la, la, la, la

[Verse 4]
She flies an airplane
She drives a subway train
At night, she pumps gasoline
She's on the council
She's on the board
She's a politician
She praises the Lord

[Chorus]
She's not just a pretty face
She's got everything it takes
She's mother of the human race
She's not, oh

[Outro]
No, she's (She's) not (not)
Just a pretty face
She's (She's) got (Got) everything it takes
She's not just a pretty face
She's got everything it takes
She's not just a pretty face
