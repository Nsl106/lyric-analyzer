[Intro]
I'm goin' up (I'm goin' up, I'm goin' up)
Oh (I'm goin' up, I'm goin' up, I'm goin' up, up, up, up)

[Verse 1]
It's 'bout as bad as it could be
Seems everybody's buggin' me
Like nothin' wants to go my way
Yeah, it just ain't been my day
Nothin's comin' easily

[Verse 2]
Even my skin is actin' weird
I wish that I could grow a beard
Then I could cover up my spots
Not play connect the dots
I just wanna disappear

[Chorus]
Up, up, up
Can only go up from here
(Up, up) Up, up
Up where the clouds gonna clear
(Up, up) Up, up
There's no way but up from here

[Verse 3]
Even somethin' as simple as
Forgettin' to fill up on gas
There ain't no explanation why
Things like that can make you cry
Just gotta learn to have a laugh
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
And up, up, up
Can only go up from here
(Up, up) Up, up
Up where the clouds gonna clear
(Up, up) Up, up
There's no way but up from here

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
When everything is goin' wrong (Don’t ya worry 'bout it)
Don't worry, it won't last for long (Don’t ya worry 'bout it, don’t ya worry 'bout it)
Yeah, it's all gonna come around (Don’t ya worry 'bout it)
Don't go let it get you down
You gotta keep on holdin' on

[Verse 1]
It's 'bout as bad as it could be (Bad as it can be)
Seems everybody's buggin' me (Everybody's buggin' me)
Like nothin' wants to go my way
It just ain't been my day (Ooh, ooh)
Nothin's comin' easily (Ooh, ooh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Ah)

[Chorus]
And up, up, up
Can only go up from here
(Up, up) Up, up
Up where the clouds gonna clear
(Up, up) Up, up
There's no way but up from here
(Up, up) Up, up, up

[Outro]
Oh, I'm goin' up (I'm goin' up)
I'm goin' up (I'm goin' up)
I'm goin' up, up, up (I'm goin' up)
I'm goin' up (I'm goin' up)
(I'm goin' up)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
