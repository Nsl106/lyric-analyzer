Girl I'm crazy for your love
Out of my head for you
My mind just can't believe
What you're makin' my body do
I'm delirious over you
And I just can't get enough
You're driving me mad
Makin' me crazy for your love

Thought I heard the telephone ringin'
It must be my imagination
Thought I heard a knockin' on the door
I guess that it was wishful thinkin'

When I close my eyes I can see your face
Feel you touchin' me
Oh darlin' don't you know
I need to find a real way
To make you see

That I'm crazy for your love
Out of my head for you
My mind just can't believe
What you're makin' my body do
I'm delirious over you
And I just can't get enough
You're driving me mad
Makin' me crazy for your love

When I close my eyes I can see your face
Feel you touchin' me
Oh darlin' don't you know
I need to find a real way
To make you see

That I'm crazy for your love
Out of my head for you
You're driving me mad
Makin' me crazy for your love
You're driving me mad
Makin' me crazy

Makin' me crazy for your love
Makin' me crazy
Crazy for your love
