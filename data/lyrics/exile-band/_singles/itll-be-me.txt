Who's gonna pick you up whenever you fall
Who's gonna be there anytime you call
It'll be me
Oh, it'll be me

Who's gonna soothe you in the middle of the night
Who's gonna hold you and make it right
It'll be me
Oh, it'll be me

I've had my share of the rough times too
You gave me all that you had
You were always there to stand by me
Now it's my turn, darling, to give it all back

Who's gonna wipe all your tears away
Who's gonna bring out the sunshine
On your cloudy days
It'll be me
Oh, it'll be me

Anytime you need to call on me
Any ol' time's okay
Darling it don't matter at all to me
You know I'll be on my way

Who's gonna pick you up whenever you fall
Who's gonna be there anytime you call
It'll be me
Oh, it'll be me
It'll be me
Oh, it'll be me
It'll be me
Oh, it'll be me
It'll be me
Oh, it'll be me
