It's gettin' late
The day's at its end
My favorite time is right around the bend
It's when the time comes to turn the lights down low

She pours the wine and I lock the door
She takes my hand like so many nights before
That's when I know
Heaven's waiting for me

She's too good to be true
She blows my mind
She's still the one who thrills me time after time
It's unbelievable
The way she moves me

She's so easy to love
So tender to hold
She touches me like no one I've ever known
The way she moves me
She's too good to be true

The radio plays a melody
One designed especially for her and me
An ol' love song that we used to slow dance to
And when she says how happy she's been
That old familiar feeling comes over me again
I count my blessings how lucky I am

She's too good to be true
She blows my mind
She's still the one who thrills me time after time
It's unbelievable
The way she moves me

She's so easy to love
So tender to hold
She touches me like no one I've ever known
The way she moves me
She's too good to be true

The way she moves me
She's too good to be true
