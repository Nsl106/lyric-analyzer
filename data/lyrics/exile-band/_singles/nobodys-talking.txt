[Verse 1]
Just got home late last night
This old town was a welcome sight
I couldn't wait to see you again
Oh how long it's been

[Verse 2]
When I opened the door, looking all around
You were nowhere to be found
I called our friends just to see
If they might know where you might be

[Chorus]
Nobody's talking, nobody's talking straight
I ask about you and they hesitate
But sooner or later, I'm gonna find out
Whatever it is nobody's talking about

[Verse 3]
I started looking, looking for you
I just didn't know what else to do
Every place I went, it was always the same

[Verse 4]
I just say your name and they turn away
Like they did not hear
What they're not saying is all too clear
In their eyes I see the sympathy
I know there's something they're not telling me

[Chorus]
Nobody's talking, nobody's talking straight
I ask about you and they hesitate
But sooner or later, I'm gonna find out
Whatever it is nobody's talking about

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Nobody's talking, nobody's talking straight
I ask about you and they hesitate
But sooner or later, I'm gonna find out
Whatever it is nobody's talking about

[Chorus]
Nobody's talking, nobody's talking straight
I ask about you and they hesitate
But sooner or later, I'm gonna find out
Whatever it is
