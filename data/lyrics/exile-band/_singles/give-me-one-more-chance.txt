Won't you give me just one more chance
Maybe we can make a little romance
No reason why you and me
Can't get it back together like it used to be
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, just another try
If I can't have you I'm gonna die gimme one more chance
Gimme one more chance

Do you remember how we used to be
When we had a love so true
You were my confidant you were my closest friend
Someone that I could always turn to

Then like a fool I let you slip right through my hands
Oh, I let you get away
Now I've come runnin' back hopin' you will let me
Back in your heart someday

Won't you give me just one more chance
Maybe we can make a little romance
No reason why you and me
Can't get it back together like it used to be
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, just another try
If I can't have you I'm gonna die gimme one more chance
Gimme one more chance

I'm so alone here without your touch
And it seems like a lifetime to me
Oh, darlin' can't you see right now I know
How wrong one man can be

Won't you give me just one more chance
Maybe we can make a little romance
No reason why you and me
Can't get it back together like it used to be
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, just another try
If I can't have you I'm gonna die gimme one more chance
Gimme one more chance

Won't you give me just one more chance
Maybe we can make a little romance
No reason why you and me
Can't get it back together like it used to be
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, just another try
If I can't have you I'm gonna die gimme one more chance
Gimme one more chance, oh

Gimme one more chance
Gimme one more chance
