If I could make one wish
And have it come true
All that I could hope for
Is for just one night with you
'Cause that's all it takes
And that's all I need
It doesn't take much of your love
To satisfy me

Just one kiss goes a long long way
Just a little of your love
Can get me through the day
Just one touch and my heart remains
Just one kiss goes a long long way

I was a loner, I had to be free
I never needed anyone around
To depend on me
But that was before you made me see
That falling in love could be painless
You made it look easy

Just one kiss goes a long long way
Just a little of your love
Can get me through the day
Just one touch and my heart remains
Just one kiss goes a long long way

I wonder how I ever got by
I wonder how I ever made it
Without you in my life
I don't know how I ever survived

Just one kiss goes a long long way
Just a little of your love
Can get me through the day
Just one touch and my heart remains
Just one kiss goes a long long way

Ooh baby, just one kiss goes a long long way
Yeah darling, just one kiss goes a long long way
Yeah baby, just one kiss goes a long long way
Yeah darling, just one kiss goes a long long way
