I don't need a shooting star
To make my wish come true
I don't need a four-leaf clover
Or a crystal ball to see through
Don't need a claim to fame
Like some folks always do
Got my very own big-time star
And she shines the whole night through

She's a miracle, a sight to see
Oh, the way she touches me
Way down deep in my soul
Something's got a hold and it won't let go
If I stumble, and if I fall
She's waiting right there to catch me, oh
She's a miracle, a miracle to me

I don't need any good-luck charms
Always hanging around
Don't need any wishing well
To throw my money down
Don't need to make the front-page news
Be the talk of the town
I'm telling all the world, I've got a heavenly girl
Right here on the ground

She's a miracle, a sight to see
Oh, the way she touches me
Way down deep in my soul
Something's got a hold and it won't let go
If I stumble, and if I fall
She's waiting right there to catch me, oh
She's a miracle, a miracle to me

She's everything in the world to me
A beautiful dream come true
Every day I count my blessings
'Cause I'm the lucky one she gives her loving to

Oh, she's a miracle, a sight to see
Oh, the way she touches me
Way down deep in my soul
Something's got a hold and it won't let go
If I stumble, and if I fall
She's waiting right there to catch me, oh
She's a miracle, a miracle

She's a miracle, a sight to see
Oh, the way she touches me
Way down deep in my soul
Something's got a hold and it won't let go...
