[Intro]
Back then, right now

[Verse 1]
Back when that blacktop was just a gravel road
Back when that Walmart was just a fishin' hole
Back when my ol' guitar had some brand-new strings
Yes, it did
Back when a work truck was just a stick shift
Back when you took a pic and didn't have to post it
Back when a Baptist church was where we learned to sing
Yeah, we did

[Chorus]
I could use some back then, right now
'98 Chevy with the tailgate down
FM only with the gold up loud
Burnin' up the night, innocent and wild
I could use a little more wide-open
Back when all I wanted was the hand I was holdin'
Livin' in the moment with the good-time crowd
Makin' life count
Damn, I could use a little more
Back then, right now
Back then, right now

[Verse 2]
Back when a, "How ya been?" came through a phone call
Back when a pastime was watchin' baseball
Yeah, back when politics, it wasn't table talk
Back when you had a fight, you could just walk it off

[Chorus]
I could use some back then right now
'98 Chevy with the tailgate down
FM only with the gold up loud
Burnin' up the night, innocent and wild
I could use a little more wide-open
Back when all I wanted was the hand I was holdin'
Livin' in the moment with the good-time crowd
Makin' life count
Damn, I could use a little more
Back then, right now
Back then, right now

[Bridge]
Back then, it was simple, it was slow
We didn't worry 'bout what we didn't know

[Chorus]
I could use some back then, right now
'98 Chevy with the tailgate down
FM only with the gold up loud
Burnin' up the night, innocent and wild
I could use a little more wide-open
Back when all I wanted was the hand I was holdin'
Livin' in the moment with the good-time crowd
Makin' life count
Damn, I could use a little more
Back then, right now

[Outro]
(Back then, back then) Yeah, back then, right...now
Yeah, back then, right now
(Back then), Yeah-eh, back then, right now
Just a little more back then, now
