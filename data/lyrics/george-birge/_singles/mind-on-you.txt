[Verse 1]
Well baby, you're a wildfire
That'll light me up
Little out of control
Yeah, you know
Baby, you're a tall drink
Little top shelf that'll get me going
Hold on

[Pre-Chorus]
We both know that road that we're going down
And right now, all I can think about

[Chorus]
I got my mind on you
And you on my mind
Got these four wheels on a two lane
And we cuttin' through the night
Got your high in my head and your love on my lips
Girl, I'm huggin' on these curves
Like them jeans on your hips
Every time you hop in lookin' like you do
I got my hands and my eyes and my mind on you
I got my mind on you
I got my mind on you

[Verse 2]
Slide a little closer, babe
Wanna get your pretty little head on my shoulder
And get closеr
Girl, you know I love the way
You slip your hand under my shirt
Thеn it's over
Go slower

[Pre-Chorus]
We both know that road that we're going down
Right now, all I can think about

[Chorus]
I got my mind on you
And you on my mind
Got these four wheels on a two lane
And we cuttin' through the night
Got your high in my head and your love on my lips
Girl, I'm huggin' on these curves
Like them jeans on your hips
Every time you hop in lookin' like you do
I got my hands and my eyes and my mind on you
I got my mind on you
I got my mind on you

[Chorus]
I got my mind on you
And you on my mind
Got these four wheels on a two lane
And we cuttin' through the night
Got your high in my head and your love on my lips
Girl, I'm huggin' on these curves
Like them jeans on your hips
Every time you hop in lookin' like you do
I got my hands and my eyes and my mind on you
I got my mind on you
I got my mind on you

I got my hands and my eyes and my mind on you
I got my mind on you and you on my mind
(I got my mind on you)
(I got my mind on you)
(I got my hands and my eyes and my mind on you)
I got my mind on you, yeah
(Got my mind on you)
