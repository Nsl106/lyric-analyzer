[Verse 1]
I don't come here much, but she loves this place
And I gotta find her
I don't smoke, but she does when drinks
So I got a lighter

[Pre-Chorus]
I like whiskey, she likes tequila
So I take one of both
Just in case she walks in, I'll be good to go

[Chorus]
She only dances to cowboy songs
Loves to get lost in a moment
She comes alive when the neon's on
Don't wanna leave 'til it's closing
So I got a twenty on the jukebox to keep it playing
Anything that sounds like Waylon
And right here's wherе I'll be staying all night long
'Cause she only dancеs to cowboy songs
She only dances to cowboy songs

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she makes love like an ember in the rain
Just something about her
One night with her'd make anyone think
They can't live without her

[Pre-Chorus]
If she rolls through, "Three Chords and the Truth"
Might get me half a chance
That steel guitar'll steal her heart if anything can

[Chorus]
She only dances to cowboy songs
Loves to get lost in a moment
She comes alive when the neon's on
Don't wanna leave 'til it's closing
So I got a twenty on the jukebox to keep it playing
Anything that sounds like Waylon
And right here's where I'll be staying all night long
'Cause she only dances to cowboy songs
She only dances to cowboy songs

[Bridge]
I'll be wasting quarters, waiting for her
Just in case she shows
And I'll be back tomorrow if she don't

[Chorus]
She only dances to cowboy songs
Loves to get lost in a moment
She comes alive when the neon's on
Know she's leaving with me when it's closing
So I got a twenty on the jukebox to keep it playing
Anything that sounds like Waylon
And right here's where I'll be staying all night long
'Cause she only dances to cowboy songs
She only dances to cowboy songs

[Outro]
I don't come here much, but she loves this place
And I gotta find her
