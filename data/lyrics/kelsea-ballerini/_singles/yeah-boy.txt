[Verse 1]
Captured my attention, make my heart stop and listen
When you look my way
Blue jeans and a ball cap, thinkin' that you're all that
And I'm thinkin' the same
You got that somethin' in your eyes, I think about it all the time
If you ever wonder if I wanna make you mine

[Chorus]
Yeah, boy
I'm diggin' what you're doin'
Yeah, boy
I'm tryna keep it cool
But you're makin' it hard, I'm wishin' your arms
Were wrappin' me up tight
Yeah, boy
You shine and you can't even help it
Yeah, boy
Your eyes could make the moon jealous
And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl tonight
Yeah, boy

[Verse 2]
Every song that's playin' gets me thinkin' 'bout you, baby
And the way you roll
So, let's put down the drop top, burn a little blacktop
Off of that road
Baby, what we waitin' on?
The stars are out, the night is young
If you wanna know if I wanna go and get gone

[Chorus]
Yeah, boy
I'm diggin' what you're doin'
Yeah, boy
I'm tryna keep it cool
But you're makin' it hard, I'm wishin' your arms
Were wrappin' me up tight
Yeah, boy
You shine and you can't even help it
Yeah, boy
Your eyes could make the moon jealous
And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl tonight
Yeah, boy

[Bridge]
Yeah, boy
I wanna take a little ride with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna spend a little time with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna sip a little wine with you (Oh)
Yeah, boy
I wanna take a little ride with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna spend a little time with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna sip a little wine with you (Oh)

[Chorus]
Yeah, boy
I'm diggin' what you're doin'
Yeah, boy
I'm tryna keep it cool
But you're makin' it hard, I'm wishin' your arms
Were wrappin' me up tight
Yeah, boy
You shine and you can't even help it
Yeah, boy
Your eyes could make the moon jealous
And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl tonight, yeah
Yeah, boy

[Outro]
Yeah, boy
Yeah, boy
I wanna take a little ride with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna spend a little time with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna sip a little wine with you (Oh)
Yeah, boy
I wanna take a little ride with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna spend a little time with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna sip a little wine with you (Oh)
Yeah, boy
