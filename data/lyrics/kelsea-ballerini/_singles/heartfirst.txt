[Verse 1]
Met him at a party
Accidentally brushed his body
On the way to get a drink at the bar
I couldn't wait 'til later
Talking in the elevator
Then we're kissing in the back of the car

[Pre-Chorus]
That voice in my head says to slow down
But it can't see the way you lookin' at me right now
It may not be next week what I need
Then again, maybe it might be

[Chorus]
Could be forever or we might break
That's just the kind of risk that we take
My head is yellin' that I could get hurt
But I'm gonna jump right in, baby, with my heart first

[Post-Chorus]
I gotta have it
Gotta see if this works
I gotta have it
Wake up in your t-shirt

[Verse 2]
Who knows what'll happen
Ain't it always kinda magic
When you don't know who's holding the cards? (Ah-ah)
Could bе a wish I never knew ya
Or pеrmanently tattooed ya
Only the moon knows what's in the stars (What's in the stars)

[Pre-Chorus]
Mmm, that voice in my head says to slow down
But it can't feel your hands on my hips right now
It may not be next year what I need
Then again, maybe it might be

[Chorus]
Could be forever or we might break
That's just the kind of risk that we take
My head is yellin' that I could get hurt
But I'm gonna jump right in, baby, with my heart first

[Post-Chorus]
I gotta have it
Gotta see if this works (I gotta have it)
I gotta have it
Wake up in your t-shirt
I gotta have it
Diving in heart first (Diving in heart first)
I gotta have it
Ooh, I gotta have ya

[Bridge]
And I can't even stop myself anymore
(Ooh, I gotta have it, yeah-yeah)
Oh, we couldn't end the perfect night outside my front door

[Chorus]
Could be forever or we might break
That's just the kind of risk that we take
My head is yellin' that I could get hurt
But I'm gonna jump right in, baby, with my heart first

[Post-Chorus]
I gotta have it
Gotta see if this works (I gotta have it)
I gotta have it
Wake up in your t-shirt (Wake up in your t-shirt, yeah)
I gotta have it
Diving in heart first (Diving in heart first)
I gotta have it
Yeah, I gotta have ya
