They say you're cold as ice
I don't believe them
Up goes my temperature when I'm next to you
They say you won't look twice
I don't believe them
I think I feel something cookin'
Baby, how 'bout you

Someday you'll see it's gonna be
No one for you, only me
Sometime, sweet destiny
Will open up your heart
And that's when I'm gonna be around just you wait and see
No more lonely you, when you're lovin' only me

Just give me your heart
I'll never break it
I could never hurt someone as wonderful as you
I'm offering you my love
You don't have to take it
But I wouldn't pass me by
'Cause I know what's good for you

Someday you'll see it's gonna be
No one for you, only me
Sometime, sweet destiny
Will open up your heart
And that's when I'm gonna be around just you wait and see
No more lonely you, when you're lovin' only me

Someday you'll see it's gonna be
No one for you, only me
Sometime, sweet destiny
Will open up your heart
And that's when I'm gonna be around just you wait and see
No more lonely you, when you're lovin' only me

And that's when I'm gonna be around just you wait and see
No more lonely you, when you're lovin' only me
