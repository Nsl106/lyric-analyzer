I won't need you to want me just the way I wanted you
And I feel pretty foolish when you've found somebody new
I think it's fair to warn you, girl, you can't treat love that way
Love's gonna get you someday

Love's gonna get you someday
And pay you back for all the times you left it in disgrace
When you least expect it, love will put you in your place
Love's gonna get you someday

I know mine's not the first love to be put up on the shelf
In fact it's not the first one you put up there yourself
I'm only sorry I won't be around to see your face
Love's gonna get you someday

Love's gonna get you someday
Pay you back for all the times you left it in disgrace
When you least expect it, love will put you in your place
Love's gonna get you someday

When I think of all the hearts that I could find to hurt
I guess it's only fair now that the tables have been turned
Speaking from experience, I think it's safe to say
Love's gonna get you someday

Love's gonna get you someday
An' pay you back for all the times you left it in disgrace
When you least expect it, love will put you in your place
Love's gonna get you someday

Love's gonna get you someday
An' pay you back for all the times you left it in disgrace
When you least expect it, love will put you in your place
Love's gonna get you someday

Love's gonna get you someday...
