Now, I don't care
If I'm not the first
Love you've known
Just so I'll be the last

No, I don't care
If I'm not the first
One you've kissed
Darling, I'll never ask

Yesterday's gone
Love me from now on
Be true to me
Forget about the past

No, I don't care
If I'm not the first
Love you've known
Just so I'll be the last

--- Instrumental ---

Yesterday's gone
Love me from now on
Be true to me
Forget about the past

No, I don't care
If I'm not the first
Love you've known
Just so I'll be the last
Darling, I'll never ask...
