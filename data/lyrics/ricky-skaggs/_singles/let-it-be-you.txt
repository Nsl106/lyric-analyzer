If I could find a love to treasure with this heart and with these hands
I could build a strong foundation in a world of shifting sands
If I could show just what I've made up it'd be surprise what I can do
But I need someone to help me let it be you
Cause I ain't to find somebody who really understands
The things that make the difference between a woman and a man
Yeah I bet all my best intentions will never see me through
If I don't find what I'm missin' let it be you
Let it be you who wakes me in the morning
Let it be you who lays down with me each night
Side by side we can dream together
Let it come true let it be you
There are lessons in this life I can't learn all by myself
There's beauty I can only see through the eyes of someone else
There's a place I've always heard of only love can take me to
But I need someone beside me let it be you
Let it be you who wakes me in the morning...
Let it come true let it be you
