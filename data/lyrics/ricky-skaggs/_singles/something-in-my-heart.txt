Well, I thought I was over you and that my heart was free
I felt like those old memories had finally let me be
So I picked up the phone to call a girl that I once knew
But when she said "Hi" well girl you know I wished that it was you

'Cause something in my heart sure makes it hard to love again
Something 'bout the way you broke it just won't seem to mend
Something in my mind tells me your memory has to end
'Cause something in my heart sure makes it hard to love again

It seem like only yesterday you promised you'd be mine
And I sure thought I heard you say until the end of time
Well, I guess I was wrong to think your love for me was true
So here I am all broken hearted all because of you...
