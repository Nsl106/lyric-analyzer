[Verse 1]
I may look like a city slicker
Shinin' up through his shoes
Underneath, I'm just a cotton picker
Pickin' out a mess of blues

[Chorus]
Show me where I start
Find a horse and cart
I'm just a country boy
Country boy at heart

[Verse 2]
I may look like a bank teller
Pushing facts in a file
But I'd rather be a hog caller
Chewing cud on the sty

[Chorus]
Show me where I start
Find a horse and cart
I'm just a country boy
Country boy at heart

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
I may look like a city slicker
Shinin' up through his shoes
Underneath, I'm just a cotton picker
Pickin' out a mess of blues

[Chorus]
Show me where I start
Find a horse and cart
I'm just a country boy
Country boy at heart
