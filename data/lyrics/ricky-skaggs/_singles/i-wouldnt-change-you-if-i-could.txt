I wouldn't change a single thing about you if I could
The way you are just suits me too a tee
A princess in a storybook
A king upon his throne
That's what we are and you belong too me

I wouldn't change you if I could
I love you as you are
You're all that I would wish for
If I wished upon a star
An angel sent from heaven
You're everything that's good
You're perfect just the way you are
I wouldn't change you if I could

Your eyes your lips, your tender smile
I'd leave them as they are
And come what may I'd never change a thing
And if I were a potter
And you a piece of clay
The only thing I'd change would be your name

I wouldn't change you if I could
I love you as you are
You're all that I would wish for
If I wished upon a star
An angel sent from heaven
You're everything that's good
You're perfect just the way you are
I wouldn't change you if I could...
