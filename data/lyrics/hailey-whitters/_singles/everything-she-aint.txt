[Verse 1]
She ain't a peach you oughta be pickin'
She ain't the cup of tea you oughta be sippin'
She treats you like you're broke, like you need fixin'
You ain't gettin' nothing back for all that you're givin'
If you're good with who you're kissin', c'est la vie
But I can show you what you're missin', yeah, boy, I can be

[Chorus]
The whiskey in your soda, the lime to your Corona
Shotgun in your Tacoma, the Audrey to your Hank
She's got a little style and a Hollywood smile
But believe me, honey, good as money in the bank
I'm everything she is and everything she ain't

[Verse 2]
She sees diamonds, but I'm seein' stars
You should leave her on an island, dance with me in this bar
Honey, there's plenty of fish in the sea
But if you take a second look, you'll see there's only one of me

[Chorus]
The whiskey in your soda, the lime to your Corona
Shotgun in your Tacoma, the Audrey to your Hank
She's got a little style and a Hollywood smile
But believe me, honey, good as money in the bank
I'm everything she is and everything she ain't

[Bridge]
She's all wrong for you
Just the girl next-door you know is right as rain

[Chorus]
The whiskey in your soda, the lime to your Corona
Shotgun in your Tacoma, the Audrey to your Hank
She's got a little style and a Hollywood smile
But believe me, honey, good as money in the bank
I'm everything she is and everything she ain't

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm everything she is and everything she ain't
