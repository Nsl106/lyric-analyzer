If the time and the place was right
Would you meet me some time late at night
And make love like we both need to
Is this something we could do
It takes a lot of nerve to take a chance
It would be worth it for the sweetest romance
Hope we can get together come time
Now here's the question that's on my mind
Do you ever fool around
Could you lay your wings aside
Does an angel ever touch the ground
Do you ever fool around
I know this would be a first time thing
To make love outside your ring
You're not free and you have your doubts
But with this feeling we'll work it out

Cause there's a need deep inside that's yours
You won't say yes but you won't say no
And no matter how hard you try
You can't hide the want that's in your eyes
Do you ever fool around
Could you lay your wings aside
Does an angel ever touch the ground
Do you ever fool around
