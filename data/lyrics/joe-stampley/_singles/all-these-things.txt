The touch of your lips next to mine
Get me excited, make me feel fine
The sound of your voice, your sweet hello
The fire inside me, when I'm holding you close

Your love's so warm and tender
Your thrill is so devine
Yet it's All These Things
That make you mine

If you would leave me, I surely would die
When you started to go, I started to cry
Now I've got it bad, but that's alright
As long as your near me every night

Your love's so warm and tender
Your thrill is so divine
Yet it's All These Things
That make you mine

Music Break...

Now I got it bad, but that's alright
As long as your near me every night

Your love's so warm and tender
Your thrill is so divine
Yet it's All These Things
That make you mine
