Roll On Big Mama!

Roll on, (roll on) big mama
I like the way you sing
Roll on (roll on) big mama
The night time lets her breathe
Well, the feel of the wheel delivers me
From a life where I don't wanna be and the diesel smoke
With every stroke sings a song with a heavy note

And ramblin is the life I chose
Sittin here between the doors
And the yellow line a keepin time
The things that's a runnin through my mind
Through my mind

Roll on (roll on) big mama
I like the way you roll
Roll on (roll on) big mama
You are my very soul

On through the snow and the drivin rain
To the forty-below in Bangor Maine
To the hundred-and-ten in the Texas sun
There ain't no road that we ain't run
Up through the Colarado mountain tops
Down to the desert where Reno stops
North to the green of Coeur D' Alene
There ain't no road that we ain't seen
We ain't seen

Roll on (roll on) big mama
You're singing out my song
Roll on (roll on) big mama
The highway is our home
Roll on(roll on) big mama

Hey anybody got a copy on this silver roadhog?
What's the smokey situation down the way, boys?
