Well she packed my bags, kicked me out
We were having bad times
Looking back I can see it was over nothing
Since then there's been too much red wine
And women messing up my mind
But nothing can compare to my baby's loving

Two o'clock this morning, I made up my mind
I'm gonna go back home to my sweet baby
I looked out the window at the city for the last time
Lord knows this life will drive you crazy

Well, I walked down to the highway, caught a semi and headed home
I Hope she'll take me back oh lord I'm praying
Now I'm standing at the front door, hope I'll find her all alone
Then I heard her sweet voice saying

And she said...
If you touch me...You've got to love me...
And If you love me...You'll have to stay...
With me...Forever, and I'll forgive you...
And love will be like it should be...
So If you touch me...You've got to love me
She said...If you touch me...
You've Got To Love Me...
