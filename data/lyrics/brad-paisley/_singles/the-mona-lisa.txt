[Verse 1]
Now there are men who make history
There are men who change the world
And there are men like me
That simply find the right girl
And in that very moment, it all becomes clear
What I’m meant to do, the reason I’m here
Now every night I thank the Lord I found you
And every time I put my arms around you

[Chorus]
I feel like the frame that gets to hold the Mona Lisa
And I don’t care if that’s all I ever do

[Verse 2]
It never fails, we walk in a room
Nobody sees me, they’re all looking at you
I disappear but that’s fine with me
I feel the same way, you’re all I can see
Now they’ve written books about da Vinci’s muse
Now I know it wasn’t but it shoulda been you

[Chorus]
'Cause I feel like the frame that gets to hold the Mona Lisa
And I don’t care if that’s all I ever do

[Verse 3]
Why don’t we run off to Paris while we’re still young
We could drink a little wine, have a little fun
I could tell you I love you in a foreign tongue
We could work on our French in more ways than one
I could take your hand, we could walk in the Louvre
I could show them real beauty, let them get a load of you

[Chorus]
'Cause I feel like the frame that gets to hold the Mona Lisa
And I don’t care if that’s all I ever do

[Chorus]
I feel like the frame that gets to hold the Mona Lisa
And I don’t care if that’s all I ever do
