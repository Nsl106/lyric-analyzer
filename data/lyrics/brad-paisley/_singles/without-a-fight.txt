[Verse 1: Brad Paisley]
There's a tangled mess of sheets on the bed
A lack of sleep poundin' in my head
We both regret some of the things we said
But we love the way it ends

[Pre-Chorus 1: Demi Lovato & Brad Paisley]
Sometimes I think
We hurt each other just because of where it'll lead
And sometimes I think
We're fighting just to be lovers and all so needlessly

[Chorus: Brad Paisley & Demi Lovato]
Good as we are at gettin' it on
How come we just can't get along?
The way we love, it don't seem right
The way we fuss, the way we fight
I got a crazy idea, how 'bout maybe tonight
We make up without a fight

[Verse 2: Brad Paisley & Demi Lovato ]
They say don't go to bed angry, that's true
But it's really something when we do
(Madder you make me, the more I want you)
Girl, I admit

[Pre-Chorus 2: Brad Paisley & Demi Lovato]
Sometimes I think
It couldn't be any better
(And I couldn't want you more)
And sometimes I think
We don't belong together
Confusing love and war

[Chorus: Brad Paisley & Demi Lovato]
Good as we are at gettin' it on
How come we just can't get along?
The way we love, it don't seem right
The way we fuss, the way we fight
I got a crazy idea, how 'bout maybe tonight
We make up without a fight

[Bridge: (Brad Paisley & Demi Lovato)]
We ain't givin' up without a fight
We can make up without a fight
(No, we ain't givin' up, we can make up)

[Outro: Brad Paisley & Demi Lovato]
Good as we are at gettin' it on
How 'bout maybe tonight
We make up
We make up without a fight
