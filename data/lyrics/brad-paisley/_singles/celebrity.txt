[Verse 1]
Some day, I'm gonna be famous
Do I have talent? Well, no
These days, you don't really need it
Thanks to reality shows
Can't wait to date a supermodel
Can't wait to sue my dad
Can't wait to wreck a Ferrari
On my way to rehab

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're a celebrity
It's adiós reality
You can act just like a fool
People think you're cool
Just 'cause you're on TV
I can throw a major fit
When my latte isn't just how I like it
When they say I've gone insane
I'll blame it on the fame
And the pressures that go with
Being a celebrity
Uh-huh

[Verse 2]
I'll get to cry to Barbara Walters
When things don't go my way
And I'll get community service
No matter which law I break
I'll make the supermarket tabloids
They'll write some awful stuff
But the more they run my name down
The more my price goes up

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're a celebrity
It's adiós reality
No matter what you do
People think you're cool
Just 'cause you're on TV
I can fall in and out of love
Have marriages that barely last a month
When they go down the drain
I'll blame it on the fame
And say it's just so tough
Being a celebrity

[Bridge]
So let's hitch up the wagons and head out west
To the land of fun and the sun
We'll be real world bachelor jackass millionaires
Hey, hey, Hollywood, here we come

[Chorus]
Yeah, when you're a celebrity
It's adiós reality
No matter what you do
People think you're cool
Just 'cause you're on TV
Being a celebrity

[Outro]
Yeah, celebrity
Oh
Oh, where's my coffee?
