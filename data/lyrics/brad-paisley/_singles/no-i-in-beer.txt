[Verse 1]
Wherever you are tonight
Whatever you're goin' through
Grab a long neck bottle or a big old pint
And let's all have a few

[Chorus]
'Cause we're all in this together
To me, it's all so clear
Drinkin' oughta be a team effort
There is no "I" in beer

[Verse 2]
So you got a buddy who's heartbroke
See if you can get him on the phone
Tell him, "Life ain't fair, we all been there"
But you don't have to drink alone

[Chorus]
'Cause we're all in this together
That's why God put us here
Drinkin' oughta be a team effort
There is no "I" in beer

[Post-Chorus]
Ain't no "U" or "I" in beer, that's right
But there's about to be a lotta beer in you and I

[Guitar Solo]
(We're all in this together)

[Verse 3]
This was gonna be our season
Yeah, we were the team to beat
Oh, but not anymore, we're lookin' at the score
In shock and disbelief

[Chorus]
But we're all in this together
And there's always next year
I'm likin' all this team effort
There ain't no "I" in beer
Yeah, we're all in this together
This why God put us here
Go 'head and check your Webster's
There ain't no "I" in beer

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Yeah, to the farmers and the first responders
To the truck drivers shiftin' gears
Every nurse that needs a break, let me buy you a drink
There ain't no "I" in beer

[Outro]
There ain't no "I" in beer
(We're all in this together)
