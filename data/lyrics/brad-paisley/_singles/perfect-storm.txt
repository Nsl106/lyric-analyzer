[Verse 1]
If she was a drink, she'd be single-barrel Bourbon on ice
Smooth with a kick, a chill and a burn all at the same time

[Pre-Chorus]
She's Sunday drive meets, high-speed chase
She ain't just a song, she's the whole mixtape
Yeah, she's so complicated, that's the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane

[Chorus]
And she destroys me in that T-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
She don't just rain, she pours
That girl right there's the perfect storm

[Verse 2]
I know how to make her laugh or blush or mad at me
But that's okay, there ain't no one more beautiful angry

[Pre-Chorus]
And she loves just as deep as she goes when she's down
The highs match the lows, can't have one without the other
And I love her just the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane

[Chorus]
And she destroys me in that T-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
But she don't just rain, she pours
That girl right there's the perfect storm

[Post-Chorus]
She's the thrill of a lifetime
A guy like me spends his whole life looking for
That girl right there's the perfect storm

[Outro]
(She destroys me in that T-shirt)
