[Verse 1]
Kevin wasn't really all that popular in school
But I remember well the day I thought now that guy's pretty cool
He pulled into the parking lot and everybody cheered
Because he'd gone and painted his entire Chevy Cavalier

[Chorus]
Camouflage (Camouflage)
Camouflage (Camouflage)
It disappears when it pulls out of his garage
Camouflage (Camouflage)
Camouflage

[Verse 2]
I asked Jenny to the prom and her mom knew how to sew
So she made a matching tux and gown from Duck Blind Mossy Oak
We took pictures in the backyard before we went to the dance
And the only thing that you can see is our faces and our hands

[Chorus]
Camouflage (Camouflage)
Camouflage (Camouflage)
You should've seen the way it popped with her corsage
Camouflage (Camouflage)
Camouflage
Ain't nothing that doesn't go with camouflage

[Bridge]
You can blend in in the country
You can stand out in the fashion world
Be invisible to a white tail, irresistible to a redneck girl

[Chorus]
Camouflage (Camouflage)
Camouflage
Oh, you're my favorite color camouflage
(Git er done)

[Bridge]
You can blend in in the country
You can stand out in the fashion world
Be invisible to a white tail, irresistible to a redneck girl

[Verse 3]
Well the stars and bars offend some folks and I guess I see why
Nowadays there's still a way to show your southern pride
The only thing as patriotic as the old red white and blue
Is green and gray and black and brown and tan all over too

[Chorus]
Camouflage (Camouflage)
Camouflage (Camouflage)
Designed by Mother Nature and by God
It’s Camouflage (Camouflage)
Camouflage
You’re my favorite color camouflage
(Git er done)
