[Verse 1]
Inflatable pool full of dad's hot air
I was three years old splashing everywhere
And so began my love affair
With water

[Verse 2]
On a river bank with all my friends
A big old rope tied to a limb
And you’re a big old wuss if you don't jump in
The water

[Bridge]
Yeah, when that summer sun starts to beating down
And you don't know what to do
Grab your swimming trunks
Ice up that old Igloo
Drive until the map turns blue

[Verse 3]
Daytona Beach on spring break
Eighteen girls up on stage
White t-shirts about to be sprayed
With water

[Break]
Oh let her go boys

[Bridge]
Yeah, when that summer sun starts to beating down
And you don't know what to do
Just go and grab someone
You want to see in a bathing suit
And drive until the map turns blue

[Verse 4]
You can stay right there when the daylights gone
Play truth or dare and it won’t take long
'Fore you and her got nothing on
But water

[Verse 5]
All you really need this time of year
Is a pair of shades and ice cold beer
And a place to sit somewhere near
Water
