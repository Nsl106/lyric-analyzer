[Verse 1]
Darling I've been standing here
Just watching you all night
And I think I've even caught you
Watching me a couple times
If I don't ask I'll never know
This may sound dumb, but here we go
Do you believe in love at first sight

[Chorus]
Me neither
I'm glad that we agree
Believe me
That's a big relief
Well, this place is awful crowded
And this music is so loud
Would you like to go and grab a bite to eat
Me neither

[Verse 2]
It's nice to finally meet a girl
Who doesn't move too fast
I was only checking
That's the reason that I asked
Relationships need time to grow
You and I should take this slow
And darling tell me, would you like to dance

[Chorus]
Me neither
I was just being polite
Thank goodness
My feet are much too tired
I'm sure you're tired too
I can see an empty booth
Would you like to maybe sit and talk a while...

[Chorus]
Me neither
We'd never get along
I'm thinking there's no chemistry at all
This has been a waste of time
And I'm running outta lines
Don't you think it's time for me to end this song
Me neither
