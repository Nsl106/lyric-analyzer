[Verse 1]
Sittin' on a bench at West Town Mall
He sat down in his overalls and asked me
"You waitin' on a woman?
I nodded "yeah" and said, "How 'bout you?"
He said, "Son, since 1952, I've been
Waitin' on a woman"

[Pre-Chorus]
"When I picked her up for our first date
I told her I'd be there at 8
And she came down the stairs at 8:30
She said, 'I'm sorry that I took so long
Didn't like a thing that I tried on'
But let me tell you, son, she sure looked pretty"

[Chorus]
"Yeah, she'll take her time
But I don't mind waitin' on a woman"

[Verse 2]
He said the wedding took a year to plan
"You talk about an anxious man, I was nervous
Waitin' on a woman"
And then he nudged my arm like old men do
And said, "I'll say this about the honeymoon, it was worth it
Waitin' on a woman"

[Pre-Chorus]
"And I don't guess we been anywhere
She hasn't made us late I swear
Sometimes, she does it just 'cause she can do it
Boy, it's just a fact of life
It'll be the same with your young wife
Might as well go on and get used to it"

[Chorus]
"She'll take her time
'Cause you don't mind waitin' on a woman"

[Bridge]
"I've read somewhere statistics show
The man's always the first to go
And that makes sense 'cause I know she won't be ready
So when it finally comes my time
And I get to the other side
I'll find myself a bench, if they've got any"

[Chorus]
"I hope she takes her time
'Cause I don't mind waitin' on a woman
Honey, take your time
'Cause I don't mind waitin' on a woman"
