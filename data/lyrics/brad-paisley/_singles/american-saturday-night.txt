[Intro]
(Whoa oh oh oh)
(Whoa oh oh oh)

[Verse 1]
She's got Brazilian leather boots on the pedal of her German car
Listening to The Beatles singing "Back in the USSR"
She's going around the world tonight but she ain't leaving here
She's just going to meet her boyfriend down at the street fair

[Chorus]
And it's a French kiss, Italian ice
Spanish moss in the moonlight (whoa oh oh oh)
Just another American Saturday night

[Verse 2]
There's a big toga party tonight down at Delta Chi
They got Canadian bacon on their pizza pie
They got a cooler full of cold Coronas and Amstel Light
It's like we're all living in a big old cup
Just fire up the blender, mix it all up

[Chorus]
It's a French kiss, Italian ice
Margaritas in the moonlight (whoa oh oh oh)
Just another American Saturday night

[Bridge 1]
You know everywhere has something they're known for
Although usually it washes up on our shores
My great-great-great-granddaddy stepped off of that ship
I bet he never ever dreamed we'd have all this

[Bridge 2]
You know everywhere has something they're known for
Although usually it washes up on our shores
Little Italy and Chinatown sitting there side by side
Live from New York (It's Saturday Night!)

[Chorus]
It's a French kiss, Italian ice
Spanish moss in the moonlight (whoa oh oh oh)
Just another American, I'm just another American
And it's just another American Saturday night
