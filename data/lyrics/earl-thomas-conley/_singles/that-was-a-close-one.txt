I loved her because she was there
And I knew along that it wasn't fair but I didn't care
Then I got the hell out of there
That was a close one

I kept my freedom intact got rid of the hassle and rid of the flack yeah I cut me some slack
And I never thought I'd want it back
And that was a close one

That was a close one
And if I hadn't of run she might have got away with my heart
So I played it smart
That was a close one
But I kept my cool never let down my guard
That was a close one

The winter of '79 was so cold and lonely I found a good woman she took me inside
And I swear to God I really tried
And that was a close one

Will there ever be a love of my life when I'm out of my pride And out of my mind in the nick of time
And when the feeling in here is fine
That's the close ones

That was a close one
And if I hadn't of run she might have got away with my heart
My precious heart
That was a close one
But I kept my cool and never let down my guard
That was a close one
(whew)

That was a close one
I love her because she was there
That was a close one

That was a close one
Winter of '79
That was a close one

That was a close one
She might have got away with my heart
That was a close one
