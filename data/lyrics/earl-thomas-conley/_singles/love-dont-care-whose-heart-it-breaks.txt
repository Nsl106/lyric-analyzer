I'm a lonely rider
She's the sole survivor of this love affair
But she don't care
She's a real heartbreaker
And I can't find a taker, no, that can compare
'Cause she's so rare
She never let me hurt for love
She gave me all she had
But that was only long enough
To go from good to bad

Oh but love don't care whose heart it breaks
It don't care who gets blown away
If it all falls through as a bad mistake
Love don't care whose heart it breaks

I can still remember
Every time I see her, I go back in time
And lose my mind
Yeah I'm a good pretender
I just can't believe her heart's no longer mine
It's so unkind
She never let me hurt for love
She gave me all she had
But that was only long enough
To go from good to bad

Oh but love don't care whose heart it breaks
It don't care who gets blown away
If it all falls through as a bad mistake
Love don't care whose heart it breaks

No, love don't care whose heart it breaks
