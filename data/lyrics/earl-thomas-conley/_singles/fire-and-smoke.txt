[Verse 1]
In and out of honky tonks, from one town to the next
But anything worth loving, Lord, just too hard to forget
Every day's another way of feeling more the same
Looks like I'll run out of highway before I outrun the rain

[Chorus]
But if there's fire and smoke
Ooh, what a rush I got when your love was hot
Oh, but I couldn't see that when the flame burned out
You'd leave a cold dark cloud, a raining down on me

[Verse 2]
So I'm reaching out to someone, wishing she was you instead
And everything I left behind was waiting up ahead
Pulling on the bottom, baby, looking back on you
'Cause any way's the right way, babe, as long as I pull through

[Chorus]
But if there's fire and smoke
Ooh, what a rush I got when your love was hot
Oh, but I couldn't see that when the flame burned out
You'd leave a cold dark cloud, a raining down on me

[Outro]
Yeah, when the flame burned out
You left a cold dark cloud a raining down, a raining down on me
(Ooh, raining down) Down on me
(Ooh, raining down) Raining down on me
(Ooh, raining down) Raining down on me
