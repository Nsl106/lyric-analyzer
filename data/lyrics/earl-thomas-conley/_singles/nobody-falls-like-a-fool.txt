[Verse 1]
The heart isn't blind
It just sees what it wants to see
I hope yours is lookin' at mine
The way that you're lookin' at me
Girl, I've been around
I've taken chances before
But this time, I'm hopin' for more
You're makin' it easy

[Chorus]
Nobody falls like a fool
Nobody loves like a believer
After so many dreams have fallen through
It's time that one came true
Nobody falls like a fool
Nobody loves like a believer
And I'm fallin'
'Cause I believe in you

[Verse 2]
I know you're afraid
Of the words we have spoken
There's been so many promises made
And so many broken
Oh, but please don't hold back
I've already opened the door
And this time, I'm hopin' for more
You're makin' it easy

[Chorus]
Nobody falls like a fool
Nobody loves like a believer
After so many dreams have fallen through
It's time that one came true
Nobody falls like a fool
Nobody loves like a believer
And I'm fallin'
'Cause I believe in you
Nobody falls like a fool
Nobody loves like a believer
After so many dreams have fallen through
It's time that one came true
Nobody falls like a fool
Nobody loves like a believer
