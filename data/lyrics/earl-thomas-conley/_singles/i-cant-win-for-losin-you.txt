Hey how you been? It's good to see you again
Gee it's been a long time
How's that new man, mama and dad?
Since I told you goodbye

Well I'm still the same, still raising cane
Nobody's worried about me
I come and I go, just as I please
Since I set myself free

But I can't win for losing you, I just can't get over you
Being foot loose and fancy free, ain't all it's creaked to be
And the grass ain't no greener here on the other side
I might win a heart or two but I can't win for losing you

Well I'm on my way, there's so much to say
Lord knows that I've had my time
But girl you can bet, I'll never forget
When you used to be mine

But I can't win for losing you, I just can't get over you
Being foot loose and fancy free, ain't all it's creaked to be
And the grass ain't no greener here on the other side
I might win a heart or two but I can't win for losing you

No, I can't win for losing you I just can't get over you
Being foot loose and fancy free
