[Verse 1]
You proved to me that I don't need to be all by myself to feel alone
'Cause lately, conversation only comes when someone's calling on the phone

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but I'm not asking questions
Afraid that I might find out what's really wrong

[Chorus]
You give me that silent treatment
I can take it or leave
I'm getting that silent treatment
It's working on me

[Verse 2]
Oh, but leaving off all the changes
I remember back when, our love, it didn't hurt
Like when I'd wake up close beside you
And you'd just lay there begging me
Stay home from work

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you don't like to talk about it
But lately we've been missing more than words

[Chorus]
I'm getting that silent treatment
I can take it or leave
You give me that silent treatment
It's working on me (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
On me, on me

[Bridge]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
I'm getting that silent treatment
I can take it or leave
You give me that silent treatment
It's working on me (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
On me, on me

[Outro]
You got it working, working on me (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Ooh-ooh, oh, yeah
You got it working, working on me (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
