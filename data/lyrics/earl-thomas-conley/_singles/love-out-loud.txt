I don't brag about you to everyone I meet
I don't sing you praise's in the crowd
Oh but deep inside my heart you're the most important part
Oh I'm just no good at love....... out....... loud

When you're here beside me
Deep......in my arms
I can't seem to get my feelings out
I know that you deserve
The tenderness of words
But I'm.... just no good at love..... out...... loud

Love out loud it don't come easy
Love out loud is hard for me
Deep inside my heart is singing
And reciting poetry
Please don't read my silence as a cause for any doubt
I'm just no good at love..... out..... loud

There's some real good talkers
I hear them every day
But I'm not sure they know what love's about
Oh, but everything I do is a silent "I love you!"
And I'm just no good at love..... out..... loud

Love out loud it don't come easy
Love out loud is hard for me
Deep inside my heart is singing
And reciting poetry
Please don't read my silence as a cause for any doubt
I'm just no good at love
I'm just no good at love
I'm just no good at love..... out..... Loud

Love out loud
Love out loud
Love out loud
