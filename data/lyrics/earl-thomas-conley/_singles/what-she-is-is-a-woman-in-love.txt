There's a lot of nice things
That he never told her
And he forgets to hold her
When she needs him sometimes

The promises he made her
He never got around to
Still the thought of leaving
Never crossed her mind

What she sees
Is only what she wants to
What she has
She thinks is enough
What she does
Is just look at the good things
And what she is
Is a woman in love

He forgets to call her
So he keeps her waiting
He's always breaking the plans that she's made
There's so many good things
That he never gave her
But it never mattered to her anyway

Cause what she sees
Is only what she wants to
What she has
She thinks is enough
And what she does
Is just look at the good things
And what she is
Is a woman in love

And he's just an ordinary guy
Like you and I
And she's looking at him with her heart
And not her eyes

What she sees
Is only what she wants to
What she has
She thinks is enough
What she does
Is just look at the good things
And what she is
Is a woman in love

What she sees
Is only what she wants to
What she has
She thinks is enough
What she does
Is just look at the good things
And what she is
Is a woman in love
