[Verse 1]
I have held you, girl
But you ain't never made me feel so good before
Mmm-mmm, love you some more
And I have kissed you, girl
But your lips ain't never tasted quite so sweet and warm
Mmm-mmm, sweet and warm
And I have loved you, girl
But I ain't never really loved you from the heart
But tonight, I'm gonna start

[Chorus]
Oh, with every touch, you're painting
Pretty pictures with your hands
Creating precious feelings
That my body understands
I can almost hear the music
Playing somewhere soft and low
I have loved you girl, mmm
But not like this before

[Chorus]
Oh, with every touch, you're painting
Pretty pictures with your hands
Creating precious feelings
That my body understands
I can almost hear the music
Playing somewhere soft and low
I have loved you girl, mmm
But not like this before
Yeah, I have loved you girl, mmm
But not like this before
