Can't take back the angry words we've said
Can't forget the bitter tears we've shed
Just can't seem to get along
Even though the feelings strong
This lovin' hours just cannot move ahead

We always seem to come back home
Can't be bad enough at all
Must be something we can't do without
With the best behind us now
There's no way in and no way out
Living in the shadow of a doubt

Have we pasted the point of no return?
We can't cross the bridges that we've burned
Does it matter any more, is it still worth fighting for?
Or have we gone as for as we're concerned?

We always seem to come back home
Can't be bad enough at all
Must be something we can't do without
With the best behind us now
There's no way in and no way out
Living in the shadow of a doubt

With the best behind us now
There's no way in and no way out
Living in the shadow of a doubt
Just living in the shadow of a doubt
