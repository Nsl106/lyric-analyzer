[Verse 1]
You've never cheated, you've never lied
You've never had feelings that you've had to hide
For she's got you thinkin' of something so different tonight
It's too late to worry what's right or what's wrong
And you're a little too crazy to leave it alone
When you're lookin' at somethin' and it's too good to push it aside

[Chorus]
Boy, she's got your head in the clouds
And your heart in a bind
So how come you're feelin' so proud
When your love's on the line?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You still think your first love's the best in your life
When you know you should hurry but you can't say goodbye
And you know you can't go back and feel like you're where you belong
Now the sweet taste of freedom is hard to control
When the touch of a woman's so tender to hold
She won't even let you remember how long you've been gone

[Chorus]
Boy, you've got your head in the clouds
And your heart in a bind
So how come you're feelin' so proud
When your love's on the line?
Yeah, you've got your head in the clouds
And your heart in a bind
So how come you're feelin' so proud
When your love's on the line?

[Instrumental Outro]
