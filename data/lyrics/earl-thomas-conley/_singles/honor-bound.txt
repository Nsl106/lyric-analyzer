[Verse 1]
Nothing's been said, nothing's been done
It's hard to see a difference between the rising and setting sun
But I can feel a change it's there in her touch
It's suttle but it's deep and it hurts us both so much
Me because I'm losing her and her because she feels

[Chorus]
She's honor bound, bound by promise that she made so long ago
But I love her so much that I can't let her know I know
Oh I know her pure heart made that promise
Honestly, oh but how long can her honor keep her bound to me

She's trying so hard, but it's taking it's toll
Trying to keep her heart warm with a love slowly growing cold
But who knows what is right when everything's wrong
No matter what I do now it won't matter when she's gone
But I how long can I keep holding her when she's only holding me

She's honor bound, bound by promise that she made so long ago
But I love her so much that I can't let her know I know
Oh I know her pure heart made that promise
Honestly, oh but how long can her honor keep her bound to me

Nothing's been said, nothing's been done
It's hard to see a difference between the rising and the setting sun
