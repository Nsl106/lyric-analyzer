[Verse 1]
I'd be sittin' in the same old bar
Heart breakin' on a broken barstool
Wishin' she'd come runnin' back, runnin' from the past
Runnin' up the tab, drinkin' for two
But that night my boys showed up
Dragged me out on the town, had to pick me up
I'd never know what I was missin' if they didn't

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in a while I should make one too
Sometimes, the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you (Never found you)
Never found you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I still go out sometimes
But I don't ever try to get that drunk
Now when I can't sleep, it's 'cause you're all over me in the sheets
All night keepin' me up
Yeah, it's hard to believe that a goodbye could be
So good to me

[Chorus]
No, I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in a while I should make one too
Sometimes, the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you
Mmm, no, I'd have never found you

[Bridge]
And now I'm takin' back the way I said I wish I'd never met her
Sometimes, the things that don't work out couldn't work out any better
I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in a while I should make one too
Sometimes, the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you
Never found, never found you
No, I'd have never found you, mmm
