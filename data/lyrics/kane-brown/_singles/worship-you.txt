[Verse 1]
Your kisses have a higher power
Your body, baby, it's divine
Every time I see you smile
It's like I've seen the light
Sleeping next to you is Heaven
But you already know 'bout that
Wanna glorify every part of you so bad

[Chorus]
Don't get me wrong
I'm a God fearing Christian man
But if you were a religion then, damn
I don't know what I'd do
Yeah, I might have to worship you
I might have to sing your praise
I might have to go to church, yeah
Every single night and day
Yeah, I might have to hit my knees
'Cause you lay it on me like the truth
And you love me like Hallelujah
I might have to worship you
Yeah, I might have to worship you
I might have to worship you (I might have to worship you)

[Verse 2]
And I ain't saying you can walk on water
Or that you can turn it into wine
But, girl, it feels like a miracle that you're mine

[Chorus]
So don't get me wrong
I'm a God fearing Christian man
But if you were a religion then, damn
Yeah, I don't know what I'd do
Yeah, I might have to worship you
I might have to sing your praise
I might have to go to church, yeah
Every single night and day
Yeah, I might have to hit my knees
'Cause you lay it on me like the truth
And you love me like Hallelujah
I might have to worship you
I might have to worship you
Woo
Said I might have to worship you
Don't get me wrong
I'm a God fearing Christian man
But if you were a religion then, damn
Said I don't know what I'd do
Yeah, I might have to worship you
I might have to sing your praise
I might have to go to church, yeah
Every single night and day
I might have to hit my knees
'Cause you lay it on me like the truth
And you love me like Hallelujah
I might have to worship you
Yeah, I might have to worship you
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I might have to worship you (I might have to worship you)
