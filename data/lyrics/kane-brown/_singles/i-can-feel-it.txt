[Verse 1]
I can see you by the bar
Skinny margarita with a broken heart
So I slid over like a steel guitar
We started talkin' 'til I
Saw your boots bounce to the beat
You said, "Do you dance? Wanna dance with me?"
Next thing I know, I started to think
That we might be onto somethin'

[Pre-Chorus]
You're puttin' on a show
No need to take it slow
There's something here, I know

[Chorus]
I can feel it in the air, feel it in the whiskey in my hand
In your hips, your body tells me when you start to dance
Maybe this is turning to a "We should probably get up out of here"
Oh, baby, I swear, I can feel it in the air (I can feel it)
I can feel it, mm

[Verse 2]
You got everybody lookin'
Lookin' at you, lookin' at me
Thеm words you're whisperin' in my ear
Girl, thеy're as smooth as Tennessee

[Pre-Chorus]
We got all night to go
This flame ain't burnin' low
There's something here, I know

[Chorus]
'Cause I can feel it in the air, feel it in the whiskey in my hand
In your hips, your body tells me when you start to dance
Maybe this is turnin' to a "We should probably get up out of here"
Oh, baby, I swear, I can feel it in the air

[Bridge]
I can feel it
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it comin' in the air tonight
Oh, Lord

[Chorus]
'Cause I can feel it in the air, feel it in the whiskey in my hand
In your hips, your body tells me when you start to dance
Maybe this is turnin' to a "we should probably get up out of here"
Oh, baby, I swear, I can feel it in the air (I can feel it)
(I can feel it)

[Outro]
I can feel it in the air (I can feel it)
(I can feel it)
Say, I can feel it in the air
I can feel it
I can feel it
