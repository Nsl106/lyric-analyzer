[Verse 1]
I know I don't say, "You're beautiful" enough
But that don't mean it ain't on my mind
And I know sometimes we have differences and fight
But I hate when I see you cry

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you're ever worried I got one foot out that door
I can promise you right now, baby

[Chorus]
My love won't leave you alone
Just so you know
When I say forever, girl
I mean I'm never, ever gonna do you wrong
And I won't let you go
Talkin' us growin' old
Here's dusk 'til dawn
We'll be goin' on and on
Baby, my love won't leave you alone
No-oh

[Verse 2]
Just like that red winе stain on the carpet
Yeah, girl, I ain't goin' no whеre (Hell nah)
And kinda like your favorite jeans with the hole in the pocket
Wherever you go, I'll be there

[Chorus]
'Cause my love won't leave you alone
Just so you know
When I say forever, girl
I mean I'm never, ever gonna do you wrong
And I won't let you go
Talkin' us growin' old
Here's dusk 'til dawn
We'll be goin' on and on
'Cause my love won't leave you alone

[Post-Chorus]
Leave you alone (Won't leave you)
Leave you alone
Leave you alone (No, I won't)
Leave you alone (Won't leave you)
Leave you alone

[Bridge]
And I don't know what life will look like fifty years down the road
But you can count on me bein' right here

[Chorus]
'Cause my love won't leave you alone
Just so you know
When I say forever, girl
I mean I'm never, ever gonna do you wrong
And I won't let you go
Talkin' us growing old
Here's dusk 'til dawn
We'll be goin' on and on
'Cause my love won't leave you alone

[Post-Chorus]
Leave you alone
Leave you alone (I won't leave you alone)
Leave you alone
Leave you alone (Oh, no, I won't)
Leave you alone
No, I won't leave you alone
