[Verse 1]
Dancy was a deacon, every Sunday found him there
At the Lighthouse Gospel Church with his hands folded in prayer
And standing right beside him was his pretty hometown bride
But no one could have guessed what he was praying deep inside

[Verse 2]
Dancy has a demon living somewhere in his past
A dark-haired Cajun angel was the devil dressed in black
Was it really voodoo or just weakness in the man?
The only time he ever fell was when she took his hand

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's been so long
But it's still so strong

[Chorus]
Every night, the devil comes and walks through Dancy's dream
She takes him by the hand and leads him back to New Orleans
A good man's going crazy somewhere in between
The hymns on Sunday morning and the sins in Dancy's dream

[Verse 3]
Sometimes it's almost like he was never even there
But other times he swears he smells the flowers in her hair
He never told his secret, no one would understand
She's the only one who's seen the dark side of the man

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's been so long
But it's still so strong

[Chorus]
Every night, the devil comes and walks through Dancy's dream
She takes him by the hand and leads him back to New Orleans
A good man's going crazy somewhere in between
The hymns on Sunday morning and the sins in Dancy's dream

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's been so long
But it's still so strong

[Chorus]
Every night, the devil comes and walks through Dancy's dream
She takes him by the hand and leads him back to New Orleans
A good man's going crazy somewhere in between
The hymns on Sunday morning and the sins in Dancy's dream
