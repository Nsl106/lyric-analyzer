[Verse 1]
Changin' my life with your love
Has been so easy for you
And I'm amazed every day
And I'll need you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Til all the mountains are valleys
And every ocean is dry, my love

[Chorus]
I'll be yours until the sun doesn't shine
'Til time stands still
Until the winds don't blow
When today is just a memory to me, I know
I'll still be loving
I'll still be loving you
I'll still be loving you

[Verse 2]
Never before did I know
How loving someone could be
Now I can see, you and me
For a lifetime

[Pre-Chorus]
Until the last moon is rising
You'll see the love in my eyes, my love

[Chorus]
I'll be yours until the sun doesn't shine
'Til time stands still
Until the winds don't blow
When today is just a memory to me
I know
I'll still be loving
I'll still be loving you

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
I'll be yours until the sun doesn't shine
'Til time stands still
Until the winds don't blow
When today is just a memory to me, I know
I'll still be loving
I'll still be loving you
I'll still be loving you

[Outro]
I'll still be loving
I'll still be loving you
I'll still be loving you
I'll still be loving
I'll still be loving
I'll still be loving you
I'll still be loving
I'll still be loving you
I'll still be loving you
I'll still be loving
I'll still be loving
