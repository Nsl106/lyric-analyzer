Sometimes a woman and a man make plans
And then change in the middle of the stream
Why does the flame die
Where does the blame lie?
And what becomes of their dreams?
Will I be startin' on my own again brand new?
Or will I be rebuilding what I once had with you?

(CHORUS)
Say you don't need me
And I'll be gone
Say that you want me
And I'll come on home
I can take anything
But standing in the dark
Don't hold nothing back
Please say what's in your heart

We always said we'd tell each other everything
That we were feeling deep inside
Now when I see your eyes
No matter how you try
You're feeling something you can't hide
Everyone knows one way that love's supposed to be
But in the real world there ain't no guarantee

(CHORUS)
I'll still love you no matter what you say
I'll stand beside you
But I won't stand in your way
Baby

(CHORUS)
