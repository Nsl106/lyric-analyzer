[Verse 1]
That lonesome Texas sun was setting slow
And in the rearview mirror
I watched it go
I can still see the wind in her golden hair
I close my eyes for a moment
I'm still there

[Chorus]
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
Like the stars that fill the midnight sky
Her memory fills my mind
[Background vocals:] Where did I go wrong?

Did I wait too long?
Or can I make it right?
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight

[Verse 2]
Another town
Another hotel room
Another dream that ended way too soon
Left me lonely praying before the dawn
Searching for the strength to carry on

[Chorus]
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
Like the stars that fill the midnight sky
Her memory fills my mind
[Background vocals:] Where did I go wrong?

Did I wait too long?
Or can I make it right?
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight

[Bridge]
For every heart you break
You pay a price
But I can't forget the tears in her blue eyes

[Chorus]
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
Like the stars that fill the midnight sky
Her memory fills my mind
[Background vocals:] Where did I go wrong?

Did I wait too long?
How can I make it right?
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
