(CHORUS)
Big dreams in a small town
Eighteen and glory bound
Nothing here to tie us down
Big dreams in a small town

Rollin' down a dusty road in my daddy's Ford
I wish that I could feel that way again
I remember those summer nights on the brink of love
You and I made more then plans back then

(CHORUS)
We were gonna try to set the world on fire
We were gonna make it all come true
We used to say that we couldn't wait to leave this town
That was something we were born to do

(CHORUS)
Oh, ain't it funny how it always seem
That time has a way of changin' all your dreams

Big dreams in a small town
Guess it's time to settle down
Don't ya like the way it sounds
Big dreams in a small town

Big dreams in a small town
Big dreams in a small town
Big dreams in a small...town
