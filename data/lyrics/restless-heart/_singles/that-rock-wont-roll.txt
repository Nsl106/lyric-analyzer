Every little move she makes
Is gonna catch somebody's eye
You ought to see all the double-takes
When she goes walkin' by
But she's so distant
She seems so cold

Everybody says that rock won't roll
They say the girl's got a heart of stone
That rock won't roll
Oh, but she's too pretty to be alone
I've got all this love inside me
And I've just got to see
If that rock won't roll

I'll give her everything I've got
I'm gonna change her point of view
I'll keep tryin' and I won't stop
Until the love in her eyes shines through
When I show her
This heart of gold

Then we'll see if that rock won't roll
They say the girl's got a heart of stone
That rock won't roll
Oh, but she's too pretty to be alone
I've got all this love inside me
And I've just got to see
If that rock won't roll

Instrumental Break

I've got all this love inside me
And I've just got to see
If that rock won't roll

Oh, she's so pretty
But that rock won't roll
Oooh, and I've just got to see

To Fade

If that rock won't roll
That rock won't roll
I just can't believe that rock won't roll
