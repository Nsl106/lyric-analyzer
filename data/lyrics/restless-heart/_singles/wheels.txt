(Verse 1)
Some people are born to live alone
And go about life that way
Their home is a long stretch
Of blacktop and everyday
Is just another day
They like movin' and stayin on the run
And tryin' to make the world stand still
White lines and city limit signs
And life is like an automobile's
Rollin' down the highway what a fine time
That's the only way to feel

(Chorus)
Wheels
Stay under me
Stay under me
Wheels
Stay under me
Stay under me

(Verse 2)
It's a freedom that we all wanna know
It's an obsession to some
To keep the world in your rearview mirror
While you try to run down the sun
It's the knowin' when you
Get to where you're goin'
You're never there against your will
White lines and city limit signs
And life is like an automobile
Rollin' down the highway what a fine time
That's the only way to feel

(Chorus)
Wheels
Stay under me
Stay under me
Wheels
Stay under me
Stay under me
Wheels
I love to feel you turn
I love to feel you under me

(Break)
Wheels turn around
Round round like geronomo

(Bridge)
It's a code for livin on the road
Try to make the world stand still
Rollin' down the highway
Rollin' down the highway
Ooohhh

(Chorus)
Wheels
Stay under me
Stay under me
Wheels
Stay under me
Stay under me
Wheels
I love to feel you turn
I love to feel you under me
Wheels
Stay under me
Stay under me
