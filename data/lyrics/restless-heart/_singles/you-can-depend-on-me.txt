Just as long as that old river flows
The sun comes up and that north wind blows
Just as sure as these are guaranteed
Honey, you can depend on me

This day and time, lovers come and go
When it seems, there?s no one left to hold
For so many, when the morning comes around
But girl, you can bet, this ol? boy can?t be found

Just as long as that old river flows
The sun comes up and that north wind blows
Just as sure as these are guaranteed
Honey, you can depend on me

Together, never to part
Forever, you can bet your heart

Just as long as that old river flows
The sun comes up and that north wind blows
Just as sure as these are guaranteed
Honey, you can depend on me

Oh, together, never to part
Forever, you can bet your heart

Just as long as that old river flows
The sun comes up and that north wind blows
Just as sure as these are guaranteed
Honey, you can depend on me

Together and forever in sweet harmony
You can depend on me
