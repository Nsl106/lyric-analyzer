[Verse 1: Blake Shelton]
I've always been a rollin' stone
With a reckless streak
Yeah, the grass never gets too grown
Underneath my feet

[Pre-Chorus]
The city lights, Southern stars
No such thing as gone too far

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
I'm runnin' wide open
I was born with my feet in motion
But since I met you, I swear
I could be happy anywhere
Any map dot location
You're always my destination
You're the only thing that I'm chained to
I could be happy anywhere
I could be happy anywhere with you

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton & Both]
Yeah, the beauty of the northern lights
In my mind has faded
The blue sky over Telluride
Next to you's kinda overrated
The windin' road, let it twist
My home's wherever your heart is

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
I'm runnin' wide open
I was born with my feet in motion
But since I met you, I swear
I could be happy anywhere
Any map dot location
You're always my destination
You're the only thing that I'm chained to
I could be happy anywhere
I could be happy anywhere with you

[Post-Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Hey!
Hey!

[Bridge: Blake Shelton & Both]
So, girl, I hope you know
Wherever you go, I go, I know

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
I'm runnin' wide open
I was born with my feet in motion
But since I met you, I swear
I could be happy anywhere
Any map dot location
You're always my destination
You're the only thing that I'm chained to
I could be happy anywhere
I could be happy anywhere with you

[Outro: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
I could be happy anywhere with you
