[Verse 1]
She cut me loose and caught herself a somewhere wind
I haven't heard a word and haven't seen her since
She disappeared quicker than this double shot of Jim
'Cause everybody at the bar started askin'

[Pre-Chorus]
"How's your girl?"
She ain't my girl
"Where she been?"
I ain't quite sure
Good question, no tellin', but I'm bettin'

[Chorus]
She's probably in Texas
Amarillo, all I know
George Strait said it
Yeah, that's where all them exes go
If she ain't with me out here in Tennessee
Then I don't know where she's headed
If I'm guessin', I reckon
She's probably in Texas
She's probably in Texas

[Verse 2]
She might be down in Georgia at her mama's for the week
Could be Carolina, California, something's tellin' me
She's somewhere in the Lone Star state with all the rest
Yeah, that one King song knows best

[Chorus]
She's probably in Texas
Amarillo, all I know
George Strait said it
Yeah, that's where all them exes go
If she ain't with me out here in Tennessee
Then I don't know where she's headed
If I'm guessin', I reckon
She's probably in Texas
She's probably in Texas

[Pre-Chorus]
"How's your girl?"
She ain't my girl
"Where she been?"
I ain't quite sure
Good question, no tellin', but I'm bettin'

[Chorus]
She's probably in Texas
Amarillo, all I know
George Strait said it
Yeah, that's where all them exes go
If she ain't with me out here in Tennessee
Then I don't know where she's headed
If I'm guessin', I reckon
She's probably in Texas
She's probably in Texas

[Outro]
She's probably in Texas
She's probably in Texas
