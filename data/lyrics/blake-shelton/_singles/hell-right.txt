[Intro: Trace Adkins & Blake Shelton]
Hey
Yeah?
Tell 'em that story you were tellin' me

[Verse 1: Blake Shelton]
Couple boys clock out 'bout 5:35
Tryna put a little hammer in their head
Standin' in the liquor store, starin' at a fifth
But they picked up a handle instead

[Refrain: Blake Shelton & Trace Adkins]
Hell right (Hell right?)
Hell right (Okay)

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton, Trace Adkins, Both]
Couple girls with their boots on got their Bluetooth on
T-shirts sayin' "Go Sooners"
Then the girl from the small town took off the "Old Town"
Put on a little Hank Jr. (
Thank God
)
Hell right
She got all her rowdy friends comin' over tonight

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Trace Adkins]
Hell right (Hell right)
Hell right (Hell right)
Everybody's throwin' down on a Friday night
Somewhere in America
There's a bottle to burn and a fire to light
And you ain't done nothin' if you did it half way
If you gonna raise Hell, then you better damn raise
Hell right (Hell right)
Hell right (Hell right)
Hell right

[Verse 3: Blake Shelton & Trace Adkins]
There's a guitar on the ground that was makin' some sound
'Til somebody pulled a hillbilly slip
Now there's fog on the window, she never woulda kissed him
If he didn't play a lick like this

[Refrain: Trace Adkins]
Hell right
Hell right

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Trace Adkins]
Hell right (Hell right)
Hell right (Hell right)
Everybody's throwin' down on a Friday night
Somewhere in America
There's a bottle to burn and a fire to light
And you ain't done nothin' if you did it half way
If you gonna raise hell, then you better damn raise
Hell right (Hell right)
Hell right (Hell right)
Hell right

[Bridge: Blake Shelton, Blake Shelton & Trace Adkins]
Now it's 7 A.M.
Damn, if there ain't an empty handle on a square hay bale
Everybody's passed out drunk, but when they wake up
They're all gonna hurt like hell, right
Yeah, boy

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Trace Adkins]
Hell right (Hell right)
Hell right (Hell right)
Everybody's throwin' down on a Friday night
Somewhere in America
There's a bottle to burn and a fire to light
And you ain't done nothin' if you did it half way
If you gonna raise hell, then you better damn raise
Hell right
Hell right
Hell right
