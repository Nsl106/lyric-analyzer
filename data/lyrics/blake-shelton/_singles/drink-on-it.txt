[Intro]
Ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Hey, girl, hey, where you goin'?
Come back and sit back down
You look too good to be headin' home so early now
You say you gotta work tomorrow
Got a lot on your mind
Let me buy another round
Girl, I think you and I should just

[Chorus]
Drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on, we can sleep on it
But for right now, girl
We just need to drink on it

[Verse 2]
We can talk rocket science, Jesus or politics
How your boyfriend cheated on you
Man, he sounds like such a prick
I could use another whiskey
And your cosmo's getting low
While we're trying to figure out
The next place we should go

[Chorus]
We can drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on, we can sleep on it
But for right now, girl
We just need to drink on it

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
This place is closing down
But I don't want to quit
Got a good thing going, girl
Let's find out what it is
And drink on it
Your place or mine, girl, we can drink on it
Dust off a bottle and drink on it
Feels like we're doing something right
Let's find a corner of the night
Where you and I can just

[Chorus]
Drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on, we can sleep on it
But for right now, girl
We just need to drink on it

[Post-Chorus]
Might make a memory that we won't forget

[Outro]
Mm, so let's just drink on it
Yeah
Mm, drink on it
Sleep on it
We could just sleep on it
