[Verse 1]
Girl, I've been thinking 'bout us
And you know I ain't good at this stuff
These feelings pilin' up won't give me no rest
This might come out a little crazy
A little sideways, yeah, maybe
I don't know how long it'll take me, but I'll do my best

[Chorus 1]
If you'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You be my sunny day
I'll be your shade tree
You be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee

[Verse 2]
Yeah, that came out a little country
But every word was right on the money
And I got you smilin', honey, right back at me
Now hold on 'cause I ain't done
There's more where that came from
Well, you know I'm just havin' fun, but seriously

[Chorus 2]
If you'll be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi
You be my Little Loretta
I'll be your Conway Twitty
You be my sugar, baby
I'll be your sweet iced tea
You be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee

[Verse 3]
Your kiss just said it all
I'm glad we had this talk
Nothing left to do but fall in each other's arms
I coulda said, "I love you"
Coulda wrote you a line or two
Baby, all I know to do is speak right from the heart

[Chorus 1]
If you'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You be my sunny day
I'll be your shade tree
You be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee

[Chorus 2]
You be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi
You be my Little Loretta
I'll be your Conway Twitty
You be my sugar, baby
I'll be your sweet iced tea
You be my honeysuckle
And I'll be your honey bee

[Outro]
I'll be your honey bee
