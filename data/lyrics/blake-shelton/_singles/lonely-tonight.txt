[Verse 1: Blake Shelton]
I never thought you'd pick up the phone
It's Friday night, you should be out on the town
Didn't think you'd be
Sittin' at home all alone like me
Nothin' on TV, nothin' to do
Nothin' to keep my mind off you and me
And the way it was
Are you thinkin' 'bout it now? Because
I could be there in five
One more one last time

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Ashley Monroe, Ashley Monroe]
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(
I need you, want you, I'm right here
)
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(
I know we shouldn't, but I don't care
)
I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you till the heartbreak's gone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton, Blake Shelton & Ashley Monroe]
That taste, that touch, the fire I miss
Those "kiss me" eyes, your red wine lips on mine
Like it used to be
Baby, I want you and you want me and

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Ashley Monroe, Ashley Monroe]
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(I need you, want you, I'm right here)
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(I know we shouldn't, but I don't care)
I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you till the heartbreak's gone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight

[Guitar Interlude]

[Bridge: Blake Shelton & Ashley Monroe]
I can be there in five
One more one last time

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Ashley Monroe, Ashley Monroe]
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(
Oh, I need you, and I'm right here
)
We don't have to be lonely tonight, tonight, tonight
Yeah, yeah
