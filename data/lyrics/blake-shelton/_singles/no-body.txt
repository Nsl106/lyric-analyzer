[Verse 1]
Dixie cup martinis
Second one's a freebie
Happy Friday afternoon
That neon sun's a-risin'
I'm sittin' here, admirin'
The summer dress that's shinin' through
Had just enough to tell you the truth

[Chorus]
Don't wanna scoot the boots with no body
Get straight tequila drunk on no body
Wrap these arms around no body
No body but yours
Don't wanna shadow dance with no body
Slide some cotton off of no body
Don't wanna wake up kissin' no body
No body but yours

[Verse 2]
Honeysuckle talkin'
Last call Old Milwaukin'
Out there to a checkered cab
B-line to your condo
Conway on the stereo
Girl, I'd love to lay you down, down, down

[Chorus]
Don't wanna scoot the boots with no body
Get straight tequila drunk on no body
Wrap these arms around no body
No body but yours
Don't wanna shadow dance with no body
Slide somе cotton off of no body
Don't wanna wake up kissin' no body
No body but yours

[Bridge]
Don't wanna hold no body
Lay eyes on no body
Lovе up on no body

[Chorus]
Don't wanna scoot the boots with no body
Get straight tequila drunk on no body
Wrap these arms around no body
No body but yours
Don't wanna shadow dance with no body
Slide some cotton off of no body
Don't wanna wake up kissin' no body
No body but yours

[Outro]
Don't wanna wake up kissin' no body
No body but yours
