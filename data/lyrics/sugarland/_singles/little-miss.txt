[Verse 1]
Little Miss Down-on-Love
Little Miss I-Give-Up
Little Miss I'll-Get-Tough
Don't you worry 'bout me anymore

[Verse 2]
Little Miss Checkered-Dress
Little Miss One-Big-Mess
Little Miss I'll-Take-Less
When I always give so much more

[Chorus]
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Yeah, sometimes you gotta lose 'til you win
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
And it'll be alright again

[Post-Chorus]
It'll be alright again—I'm okay
It'll be alright again—I'm okay (Okay)
It'll be alright again—I'm okay

[Verse 3]
Little Miss Do-Your-Best
Little Miss Never-Rest
Little Miss Be-My-Guest
I'll make more any time that it runs out

[Verse 4]
Little Miss You'll-Go-Far
Little Miss Hide-Your-Scars
Little Miss Who-You-Are-
Is-So-Much-More-Than-You-Like-To-Talk-About

[Chorus]
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Yeah, sometimes you gotta lose 'til you win
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
And it'll be alright again

[Post-Chorus]
It'll be alright again—I'm okay
It'll be alright again—I'm okay (Okay)
It'll be alright again—I'm okay

[Bridge]
Hold on
Hold on—you are loved
Are loved

[Verse 5]
Little Miss Brand-New-Start
Little Miss Do-Your-Part
Little Miss Big-Ol'-Heart-
Beats-Wide-Open—she's ready now for love

[Chorus]
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Yeah, sometimes you gotta lose 'til you win
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
And it'll be alright again

[Outro]
It'll be alright again—I'm okay
It'll be alright again—I'm okay (Okay)
(It'll be alright again)
I'm okay (It'll be alright again)
