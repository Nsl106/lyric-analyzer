[Verse 1]
I don't wanna get up, baby let's turn off the phone
I don't wanna go to work today or even put my makeup on
I got better things to do than my to-do list anyway
Hide under the covers and waste away the day
Let's just lay here and be lazy, baby, drive me crazy

[Chorus]
All I wanna do-oo-oo
All I want to do-oo-oo
Is love you, yeah

[Verse 2]
I got my whole life to change the world and climb the ladders
Looking at you looking at me is the only thing that matters
Come a little closer baby, we can talk without words
Hang a sign on the door, "Please do not disturb"
Let's just lay here and be lazy, baby, drive me crazy

[Chorus]
All I wanna do-oo-oo
All I wanna do-oo-oo
Is love you

[Bridge]
Give me a kiss from that Elvis lip
You don't wanna miss this

[Chorus]
All I wanna do-oo-oo
All I wanna do-oo-oo
Is love you

[Outro]
All I really wanna do is (Oo-oo-oo)
All I really wanna do is
All I really want to do is love you and love you and love you
Come a little closer baby (Oo-oo-oo)
We can talk without words
Hang a sign on the door
"Please do not, please do not
Please do not, please do not disturb" (Oo-oo-oo)
When I lay down in the evening (Oo-oo-oo)
All I really wanna do is
When I wake up (Oo-oo-oo)
When I wake up in the morning, baby
All I really wanna do
Oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo
