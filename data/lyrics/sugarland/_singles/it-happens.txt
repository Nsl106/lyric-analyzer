[Verse 1]
Missed my alarm clock ringin'
Woke up, telephone screamin'
Boss man singin' his same old song
Rolled in late about an hour
No cup of coffee, no shower
Walk of shame with two different shoes on

[Pre-Chorus]
Now it's poor me, why me, oh me, boring
The same old worn out, blah blah story
There's no good explanation for it at all

[Chorus]
Ain't no rhyme or reason
No complicated meanin'
Ain't no need to overthink it
Let go laughin'
Life don't go quite like you planned it
We try so hard to understand it
The irrefutable, indisputable fact is
Pshh, it happens

[Verse 2]
My trusty-rusty had a flat
I borrowed my neighbor's Cadillac
"I'll be right back," goin' down to Wally World
That yellow light turned red too quickly
Knew that truck the moment it hit me
Out stepped my ex and his new girl
"Sorry about your neck, baby"

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's poor me, why me, oh me, boring
The same old worn out, blah blah story
There's no good explanation for it at all

[Chorus]
Ain't no rhyme or reason
No complicated meanin'
Ain't no need to overthink it
Let go laughin'
Life don't go quite like you planned it
We try so hard to understand it
The irrefutable, indisputable fact is
It happens

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Ain't no rhyme or reason
No complicated meanin'
Ain't no need to overthink it
Let go laughin'
Life don't go quite like you planned it
We try so hard to understand it
The irrefutable, indisputable fact is
Yeah, the irrefutable, indisputable
Absoluteable, totally beautiful fact is...
Pshh, it happens
