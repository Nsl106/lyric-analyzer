[Verse 1]
I got miles of trouble spreadin' far and wide
Bills on the table gettin' higher and higher
They just keep on comin', there ain't no end in sight
I'm just holdin' on tight
I got someone who loves me more than words can say
And I'm thankful for that each and every day
And if I count all my blessings, I get a smile on my face
Still, it's hard to find faith

[Chorus]
But if you can look in my eyes
And tell me we'll be alright
If you promise never to leave
You just might make me believe

[Verse 2]
It's just day to day tryin' to make ends meet
What I'd give for an address out on Easy Street
I need a deep margarita to help me unwind
Leave my troubles behind

[Chorus]
But if you can look in my eyes
And tell me we'll be alright
If you promise never to leave
You just might make me believe

[Bridge]
I used to believe in us when times got tough
But lately I'm afraid that even love is not enough
Woah

[Chorus]
But if you can look in my eyes
And tell me we'll be alright
If you promise never to leave
You just might make me
Oh, you just might make me
You just might make me believe
