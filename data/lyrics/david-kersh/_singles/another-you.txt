[Verse 1]
Yesterday morning just before noon
I passed a girl wearing your old perfume
And I stopped and stared
I could almost see you standing there

[Verse 2]
Don't get me wrong I'm almost over you
But now and then I like to go walking through
Some of our old times
Even though I realize

[Chorus]
That I'll have another chance
I'll find another girl
I'll see another day
And I'll build another world
I'll start another life
Just like you told me to
I'll find another love
But there will never be another you

[Verse 3]
Night after night I go back through the years
I sit on this porch as the sun disappears
Like we did back then
And I remind myself once again

[Chorus]
That I'll have another chance
I'll find another girl
I'll see another day
And I'll build another world
I'll start another life
Just like you told me to
I'll find another love
But there will never be another you

[Bridge]
Well, I guess I should thank you
For showing me how love should feel
I know what I'm gonna look for
Cause I felt it when you held me

[Chorus]
And I'll have another chance
I'll find another girl
I'll see another day
And I'll build another world
I'll start another life
Just like you told me to
I'll find another love
But there will never be another you

[Outro]
Another you
