Ruby, Ruby
Honey are you mad at your man?

--- Instrumental ---

I was sittin' in the shade with
Shovel With my spade
Diggin' in the ground gold mine
Ruby, Ruby
Honey are you mad at your man?

I've done all I can do
Get along with you
Still you're not satisfied
Ruby, Ruby
Honey are you mad at your man?

--- Instrumental ---

If you don't believe I'm right
Then call on me tonight
I'll take you to my shady so cold
Ruby, Ruby
Honey are you mad at your man?

Ruby, Ruby
Honey are you mad at your man?..
