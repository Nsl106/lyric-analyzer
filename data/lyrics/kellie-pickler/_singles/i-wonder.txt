[Verse 1]
Sometimes I think about you
Wonder if you're out there somewhere thinkin' 'bout me
And would you even recognize
The woman that your little girl has grown up to be?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I look in the mirror, and all I see
Are your brown eyes, lookin' back at me
They're the only thing, you ever gave to me at all

[Chorus 1]
Oh, I hear the weather's nice in California
There's sunny skies as far I can see
If you ever come back home to Carolina
I wonder what you'd say to me

[Verse 2]
I think about how it ain't fair
That you weren't there to braid my hair like mothers do
You weren't around to cheer me on
Help me dress for my high school prom like mothers do

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Did you think I didn't need you here?
To hold my hand, to dry my tears
Did you even miss me, through the years at all?

[Chorus 1]
Oh, I hear the weather's nice in California
There's sunny skies as far I can see
If you ever come back home to Carolina
I wonder what you'd say to me

[Bridge]
Forgiveness
Is such a simple word
But it's so hard to do
When you've been hurt

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I hear the weather's nice in California
And just in case, you're wonderin' about me
From now on, I won't be in Carolina
Your little girl is off... your little girl is off...
Your little girl is off to Tennessee
