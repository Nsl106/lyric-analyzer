I just might take to leavin' in the middle of a night
And I might not be here in the morning light
But I'll never stop loving you, loving you

I might move into Memphis on a fast moving train
Thumbin' down some trucker
Heading west in the fast lane
But I'll never stop loving you, loving you

Just as sure as that Mississippi flows to the sea
I'll run just as wild, love just as deep
I'll never stop loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you

I might call from Atlanta for bus fare home
Call you from Dallas
To tell you what flight I'm on
But I'll never stop loving you, loving you

Just as sure as the suns sets on that beach in Malibu
I might go round the world
But I'll come back to you
I'll never stop loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you

I told you when I met you
I would never let you put chains on me
And you never tried in my life
You know that means everything

Just as sure as Manhattan is sittin' on a bed of stone
You know that I won't leave you in your bed alone too long
I'll never stop loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you

I'll never stop loving you
Loving you
Loving you, loving you, loving you
