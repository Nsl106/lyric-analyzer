She looked into a heart so sad
And saw what no one ever had
Beneath the snow she saw the spring
She finds good in everything

Give her thorns and she'll find the roses
Give her sand and she'll find the sea
Give her rain and she'll find the rainbows

Just see the love she found in me
Just see the love she found in me

She looks beneath each tear that's cried
And somehow sees the sunny side
Even on the darkest night
She knows where to find the light

Give her thorns and she'll find the roses
Give her sand and she'll find the sea
Give her rain and she'll find the rainbows

Just see the love she found in me

When the world starts closing in
She gives me strength to smile again

Give her thorns and she'll find the roses
Give her sand and she'll find the sea
Give her rain and she'll find the rainbows

Just see the love she found in me
Just see the love she found in me
