Leave me lonely, leave me alone
I got somebody special waitin' back home
She saves her love for me, I save my love for her

You're awful pretty, so pretty girl
I'd love to talk to you but I don't wanna
Lead you on to somewhere, I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go

So please understand
I'm doing the best I can

To be faithful and true
And it matters to me and her
The matter is one man faithful and true
To me, to her, and to you

Somewhere else girl, some other time
I might take you home, I might make you mine
I'd do for you what I'm doing for her

If things were different, oh, but they're now
I can't give to you what I haven't got to give anymore
I've given my love, given my love

So please understand
Doing the best I can

Please understand
I'm doing the best I can

Just leave me lonely, leave me alone
I got somebody special waitin' back home
She saves her love for me, I save my love for her

So please understand
I'm doing the best I can

To be faithful and true
And it matters to me and her
The matter is one man faithful and true
To me, to her and to you
