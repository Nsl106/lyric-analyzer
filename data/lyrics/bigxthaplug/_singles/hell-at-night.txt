[Verse 1: Ella Langley]
Heartbreak's a funny thing
How it makes you think, what it makes you want
Why, when it ends, does gettin' revenge
Sound better than movin' on?
Damn, I'd love to live and let live
Let it go, forgive and forget
Holdin' a grudge ain't what I wanna do
But when it comes to you

[Chorus: Ella Langley]
I hope it's hell at night
Straight to the mornin'
I hope you close your eyes
And just can't ignore it
'Cause it's too damn loud
Tossin' and turnin'
I hope it's hell at night
And my memory's burnin', burnin'

[Verse 2: BigXthaPlug]
Ayy, I hope you hear me every time you play a song
I hope you meet the right person but y'all never get along
I hope you know that you ain't right and you so good at burnin' bridges
I hope you finally find some love and every day, he hurt your feelings
I hope you, I hope you turn your heater on and it blow cold
I hope you leave your car runnin' at the store and it get stolen
I hope you have a nightmare every single day of your life
I hope you have a bad mornin' and one hell of a night

[Chorus: Ella Langley]
I hope it's hell at night
Straight to the mornin'
I hope you close your eyes
And just can't ignore it
'Cause it's too damn loud
Tossin' and turnin'
I hope it's hell at night
And my memory's burnin', burnin'

[Verse 3: BigXthaPlug]
Ayy, I hope you see me every time you close your eyes
And every time you think about me, you hear thunder in the sky
I'm out the way, and by the way, I hope you lived in what you learned
Hope you go deep into the woods and you make the wrong turn

[Verse 4: Ella Langley]
Hope it burns you up like a cigarette
Like a last call shot straight to the head
Hope you stare at the wall or an old home screen
Kind of hopin' I call 'cause you can't call me

[Chorus: Ella Langley]
I hope it's hell at night
Straight to the mornin'
I hope you close your eyes
And just can't ignore it
'Cause it's too damn loud
Tossin' and turnin'
I hope it's hell at night
And my memory's burnin', burnin'
