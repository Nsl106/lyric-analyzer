Temporarily yours
Love for a moment
Wrapped up in feelings we can't ignore

A once a week love
Is less than we wanted
Just for a while
Temporarily yours

Once again tonight
We found each other
We really hold each other tight
Oh again we found the time to be together
So we can ease what's been easy all our lives
