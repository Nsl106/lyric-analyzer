The telephone's ringin' and it's three a.m
And I know just who's callin'
From the same old spot and you're about half shot
Almost to the point of crawlin'

Why is it everytime we have a little fuss you take your wounded pride
And you head right straight for a bar and a bottle
And try your best to crawl inside

Please stay there 'til I get there and we'll work it out together
We'll take a little walk and have a little talk
And you'll feel a whole lot better

Just when I wonder if you're really worth the trouble that you put me through
Then you roll them baby blue eyes at me
And jump like a kangaroo
Stay there 'til I get there...

Well I thought about leavin' you many times
And I've even packed my bags a few
Then the telephone rings and I can't do a thing
But run right straight to you

Baby stay there 'til I get there...
Please stay there 'til I get there...
