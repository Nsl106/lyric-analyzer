You're my somebody special
And you know just because of you
Sometimes, I even feel like I'm somebody special too

Used to not know where to put you
Where you fit into my life
You were just another question mark in a miscellaneous file
But you eased your way into my world
And conquered space and time
And now you're always in my heart and on my mind

You're my somebody special
God blessed me good with you
You're the reason I keep trying
When I give up like I do

You're the one that makes me happy
And you know, just because of you
Sometimes I even feel like
I'm somebody special too

Took me long enough to realize
That what I had in you
Was all that I was looking for
To make my dreams come true

And now your every song
That I can't get out of my mind
Since you taught me the melody
You can sing me anytime

You're my somebody special
God blessed me good with you
You're the reason I keep trying
When I give up like I do

You're the one that makes me happy
And you know just because of you
Sometimes I even feel like
I'm somebody special too

So when you tell me that you're lonely
And you think that I don't care
I may not know how to show you
But I promise to be there
For as long as you can love me
And want me to love you
You'll be the reason for everything I do

You're my somebody special
God blessed me good with you
You're the reason I keep trying
When I give up like I do
You're the one that makes me happy
And you know just because of you
Sometimes I feel like I'm special too
