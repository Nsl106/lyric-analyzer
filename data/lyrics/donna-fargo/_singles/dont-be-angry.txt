Don't be angry with me, darling
If I fail to understand
All your little whims and wishes all the time
Just remember I'm dumb
I guess like any foolish man
And my head stays sorta foggy 'cause you're mine

Now I recall the first time that you flirted with me, dear
When you jokingly said come and be my bride
But now that time has turned the pages
It's the sweetest joke on earth

That I have you here forever by my side
And maybe someday you're gonna hurt me well
I've been hurting of before
Only God can know
And time alone will tell

But in the meantime
Well, I'll be loving you with all my heart and soul
And pray God to let it last if it's his will
So don't be angry...
Yes, my head stays sorta foggy
'Cause you're mine
