Beyond the shadow of a doubt
As the mighty river flows
As the meadow gently plays
With the wind on summer days
About as deep as deep can go

From the canyons to the sky
Like a mother as she cares
For the baby that she bears

Do I love you?
Don't you know by now?
Do I love you?
Must I show you how?

Do I love you?
Do I have to say
Do I love you?
Yes, in every way?

About as sacred as a hymn
And a Bible full of prayers
From a whisper to a roar
Very much and even more

And I'll show it with my eyes
And I'll share it with the night
And if in death
The Good Lord is kind
You'll be the last thing on my mind

Do I love you?
Don't you know by now?
Do I love you?
Must I show you how?

Do I love you?
Do I have to say
Do I love you?
Yes, in every way?

Do I love you?
Don't you know by now?
Do I love you?
Must I show you how?

Do I love you?
Do I have to say
Do I love you?
Yes, in every way?

Do I love you?
Don't you know by now?
Do I love you?
Must I show you how?

Do I love you?
Do I have to say
Do I love you?
Yes, in every way?
