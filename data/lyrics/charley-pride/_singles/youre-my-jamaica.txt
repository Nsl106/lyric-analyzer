[Verse 1]
Every day, I read ads in the paper
Sayin', "Come to the islands" (Come to the islands)
Bikinied ladies, sweet rum drinks
They'll keep you smilin' (Down in the islands)
But I've got calypso music on the record at home
When it comes to the warmth and the sunshine, well, I got my own

[Chorus]
You're my Jamaica
You're where I wanna be
You're my island when I'm bein' tossed on a stormy sea
My heavenly haven
Where I could spend eternity
You're my Jamaica, you're paradise to me

[Verse 2]
White sunny sands, palm trees, and tans
It sounds so invitin' (Sounds so inviting)
Limbo dancin' and starlight romancin'
It's all so excitin' (Come on down, come on down, come on down)
But I've got my flowery shirt and rum punch in my hand
And my own exotic lover in my native land

[Chorus]
You're my Jamaica
You're where I wanna be
You're my island when I'm bein' tossed on a stormy sea
My heavenly haven
Where I could spend eternity
You're my Jamaica, you're paradise to me
You're my Jamaica
You're where I wanna be
You're my island when I'm bein' tossed on a stormy sea
My heavenly haven
Where I could spend eternity
You're my Jamaica, you're paradise to me
You're my Jamaica
You're where I wanna be
You're my island when I'm bein' tossed on a stormy sea
