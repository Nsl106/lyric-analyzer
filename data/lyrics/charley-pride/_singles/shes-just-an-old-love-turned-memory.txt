I called her today, an accidental mistake
And her name slipped out to some friend
Forgotten old feeling's are brand new today
'Cause I'm right back where I've always been

'Cause she's just an old love turned memory
And now I seldom see her around
She's just an old love turned memory
But she still turns my world upside down

I went to some places where I knew she'd be
Just to prove our love was over and done
But the moment her eyes touched mine I knew
My sorrow had only begun

She's just an old love turned memory
And now I seldom see her around
She's just an old love turned memory
But she still turns my world upside down
But she still turns my world upside down
