Yes, I'll buy you a drink
If you'd like me to
I might even dance
A slow one with you

Lord, knows you're a looker
And, honey, what's more
It's not hard to see
What you're looking for

'Cause you're as tempting a woman
As I've ever seen
But there's someone in Dallas
Who's trusting in me

She's the mother of my children
I'm the rock she leans on
So thank you but no thank you
I'll be leaving alone

As we dance in the shadows
And you're holding me tight
I can feel the invitation
I've seen in your eyes

And the soft light and the music
And the wine's rosy glow
Ain't making it easy
For me to say no

'Cause you're as tempting a woman
As I've ever seen
But there's someone in Dallas
Who's trusting in me

She's the mother of my children
I'm the rock she leans on
So thank you but no thank you
I'll be leaving alone

So thank you but no thank you
I'll be leaving alone
