Tell me why, baby?
Why, baby?
Why, baby why?

You make me cry, baby
Cry, baby
Cry, baby, cry

Well, I got a crow I wanna pick with you
Just like last time when the feathers flew
You're runnin' wild
A-kickin' up your heels
A-leavin' me home with a hand full of bills

I can't live without you
And you know it's true
But there's no livin' with you
So what'll I do?

I'm goin' honky tonking
Getting' tight as I can
And maybe by then
You'll preciate a good man

Tell me why, baby?
Why, baby
Why, baby why?
You made me cry, baby

Cry, baby
Cry, baby cry
I can't live without you till the day that I die

Girl, now I don't know
But I've heard say
That ever' little dog is a-gonna have his day
You'd better pay attention
Don't you dare forget
Cause I'm just a little bitty puppy yet

I caught you honky tonkin' with my best friend
The thing to do was leave you
But I should'a left then

Now I'm too old to leave you
But I still get sore
When you come home a-feelin'
For the knob on the door

Well, tell me why, baby
Why baby
Why baby why
You make me cry, baby

Cry, baby
Cry, baby cry
I live without you 'til the day that I die

So tell me, why, baby?
Why, baby?
Why, baby, why

Tell me, why baby?
Why baby?
Why, baby, why?
