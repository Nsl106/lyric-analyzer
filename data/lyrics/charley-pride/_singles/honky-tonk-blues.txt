[Verse 1]
Well, I left my home down on a rural route
I told my pop I'm goin', steppin' out
Forget the honky tonk blues
Yeah, the honky tonk blues
Yeah, Lord, I got 'em
I got the honky tonk blues

[Verse 2]
Well, I went to a dance and wore out my shoes
Woke up this mornin', wishin' I could lose
Them jumpin' honky tonk blues
The weary honky tonk blues
Yeah, Lord, I got 'em
I got the honky tonk blues

[Verse 3]
Well, I stopped into, in every place in town
This city life has really got me down
I got the honky tonk blues
Yeah, the honky tonk blues
Yeah, Lord, I got 'em
I got the honky tonk blues

[Verse 4]
Gonna tuck my worries underneath my arm
Just get right back to my pappy's farm
Forget the honky tonk blues
Yeah, the honky tonk blues
Yeah, Lord, I got 'em
I got the honky tonk blues

[Outro]
Don't wanna be bothered
With the honky tonk blues
