A month ago, I walked out your door
Said it wasn't working anymore
But it's three in the morning
I'm wide awake
How long is this getting
Over you gonna take

[Chorus]
Shouldn't it be easier than this
Shouldn't it be easier than this
If goodbye was the answer
The question is
Shouldn't it be easier than this

I argue with my conscience every night
Wondering was I wrong or was I right
Well, I dial your number
But I hang up the phone
Don't think I could take it
If nobody was home
