Mountain Of Love
Standing on a mountain looking down on a city
The way I feel is a dog-gone pity
Teardrops are fallin' down the mountainside
Many times I've been here and many times I cried
We used to be so happy, when we were in love
High on a mountain of love

Night after night I been standing here alone
Weeping my heart out till cold gray dawn
Prayin' that you're lonely and you come here too
Hopin' just by chance that I'll get a glimpse of you
Tryin' hard to find you, somewhere I love
High on a mountain of love
Mountain of Love, a Mountain of Love
You should be ashamed

You used to be a mountain of love
But you just changed your name
Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church and a big tall steeple
Inside the church there's an altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringing and it should have been ours
That's why I so lonely, I dream from above
High on a mountain of love
