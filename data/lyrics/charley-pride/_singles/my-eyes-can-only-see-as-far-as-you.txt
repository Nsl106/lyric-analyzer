My eyes can only see as far as you

I stop searching all the faces in the crowd
I don't ever want to find somebody new
I'm content with loneliness if you're not in my arms
For my eyes can only see as far as you

My heart is set on loving you forever
And your love is strong enough to see me through
It'll keep me holding on to you forever
'Cause my eyes can only see as far as you

It'll keep me holding on to you forever
Cause my eyes can only see as far as you
Yes, my eyes can only see as far as you
