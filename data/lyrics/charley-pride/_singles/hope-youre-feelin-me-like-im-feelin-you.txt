No one could hold me. No one could control me
But now my future is up to you
Your loving can shake me, make me or break m
Oh I hope you're feeling me like I'm feeling you
This feeling is crazy
But only you can save me
From this love thing that I've got for you
Your love is a potion
And darling I need a notion
Oh I hope you're feeling me like I'm feeling you
Chorus
All these changes got me going in circles
First I turn away then turn right back to you
Girl I need your loving
To keep me from sinking
Oh I hope you're feeling me like I'm feeling you
Oh I hope you're feeling me like I'm feeling you
Repeat Chorus
All these changes got me going in circles
First I turn away then turn right back to you
Girl I need your loving
To keep me from sinking
Oh I hope you're feeling me like I'm feeling you
Yes, I hope you're feeling me like I'm feeling you
I want to win when I gamble
No need to ramble
I doubled my loving
When I gave it to you
I gotta do it with you
I can't do it without you
