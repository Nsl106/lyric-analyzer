Well, I came in late again last night
Really, it was this morning
I had my alibi down pat
I was gonna be charming

But the locks were all changed
I was stuck outside
With a key that no longer fit
There was a note on the door
That said, adios, sayonara
Goodbye, this is it

I don't think she's in love anymore
She's hanging up her telephone
And locking her door
I don't think she wants to
Hear anymore of my lying

I don't think she's in love anymore
She's not buying my lies like before
The only thing she wants
Out of me now is goodbye

So I went down to a phone booth
Almost down to crying
All ready to spill the truth
I see she's tired of my lying

Well, I was all ready to beg and plead
And to turn over a brand new leaf
But the second she heard
It was me on the line
I heard click, she hung up on me

I don't think she's in love anymore
She's hanging up her telephone
And locking her door
I don't think she wants to
Hear anymore of my lying

I don't think she's in love anymore
She's not buying my lies like before
The only thing she wants
Out of me now is goodbye

I don't think she's in love anymore
She's hanging up her telephone
And locking the door
I don't think she wants to
Hear anymore of my
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't think she's in love anymore
She's not buying my lies like before
The only thing she wants
Out of me now is goodbye
