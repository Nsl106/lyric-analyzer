When that neon sun comes up
In the evening
And that warm red wine and the memories
Start to flow

You'll find me there
With all the others
Just looking for love
The only way we know

Oh, we're playing night games
(Oh, we're playing night games)
Love at first sight games
(First sight games)
The only way to fight pain
Under the neon lights

Oh, we're playing night games
(Oh, we're playing night games)
Looking for the right things
(Right things)
Hoping that it might bring
Two hearts together tonight

Now if you're sitting alone tonight
And feeling lonely
And you can hear that jukebox
Calling you

And if you think it's time
You found somebody
(Somebody)
Just come on down
And do what we all do

Oh, we're playing night games
(Oh, we're playing night games)
Love at first sight games
(First sight games)
The only way to fight pain
Under the neon lights

Oh, we're playing night games
(Oh, we're playing night games)
Looking for the right things
(Right things)
Hoping that it might bring
Two hearts together tonight

Oh, we're playing night games
(Oh, we're playing night games)
Love at first sight games
(First sight games)
The only way to fight pain
Under the neon lights

Oh, we're playing night games
(Oh, we're playing night games)
Looking for the right things
