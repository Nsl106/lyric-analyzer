I've taken down all of her pictures
I've cleaned out all of her drawers
I've painted over the scratches
From all of our little wars

I've put away every gift
That she ever gave to me
Now everything is in its place
Except for her memory

And where do I put her memory
When it haunts me night and day
I can't hide it in the closet
And Lord, I can't throw it away

And where do I put her memory
When it's always in my mind
I can't chase it, erase it, I just have to face it
It's gonna be there a long, long time

I got rid of the pillow
Where she used to lay her head
I've picked up her hairpins and curlers
That she dropped on her side of the bed

I've locked away each souvenir
And thrown away the key
Now everything is in it's place
Except for her memory

And where do I put her memory
When it's always in my mind
I can't chase it, erase it, I just have to face it
It's gonna be there a long, long time
It's gonna be there a long, long time
