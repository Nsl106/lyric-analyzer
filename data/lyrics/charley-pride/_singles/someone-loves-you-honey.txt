[Verse 1]
I wanna share your life
Every minute, every day and night
And I just want you to know
That whatever you do, and wherever you go

[Chorus]
Remember someone loves you, honey
No matter what
Just be my girl
Someone loves you, honey
More than anything in the world

[Verse 2]
I'm so glad that I'm the one
That you come to when you need someone
That's what my love is for
It's a shoulder to lean on a port in the storm

[Chorus]
Remember someone loves you, honey
No matter what
I just want you to be my girl
Someone loves you, honey
More than anything in the world
