Baby it's gonna take a little bit longer for me to ever get you off of my mind
Baby it's gonna take a little bit longer cause I've been lovin' you a long long time

People try to tell me that it won't be long till I won't even miss you anymore
But I can tell them it must be something mighty wrong every day I want you even more
And baby it's gonna take...

They say this lonely feeling it'll go away but after all this time now it ain't gone
Every weaken moment and every night and day just seems to keep on keeping on
And baby it's gonna take...
Yes I've been lovin' you a long long time
