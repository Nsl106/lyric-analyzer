Well, I wake up every mornin'
Throw some water on my face
I look up in the mirror
I can see that nothing's changed

I don't know why I go to bed
'Cause I never sleep a wink
All I do without you here
Is lie awake and think

Missin' you
Every night, I call your name
Missin' you
Every day the same old thing

Missin' you
Oh, what else can I do?
The sun comes up, the sun goes down
And I'm still missin' you

I went to church last Sunday
And I got down on my knees
I sent up a prayer just askin' please
Just to send down a little peace

You know, lately I just walk the line
To occupy my time
But I end up where I started from
With you back on my mind

Missin' you
Every night, I call your name
Missin' you
Every day the same old thing

Missin' you
Oh, what else can I do?
The sun comes up, the sun goes down
And I'm still missin' you

The sun comes up, the sun goes down
And I'm still missin' you
