[Verse 1]
I should have done what I'm gonna do a long time ago
Givin' you up, you got me down to an all time low
I've been a fool, been a fool lovin' your kind
I'm gonna try something new to get over you this time

[Chorus]
There'll be no more one more time
Baby I might be crazy but Ill never call you baby anymore
You had your last second chance at this old heart of mine
And there'll be no more one more time

[Verse 2]
I'd like to say, but I can't say that it's been fun
You had my heart locked away in the dark and it could use some sun
I'm gonna miss you a lot, Honey I've got to let you go
So go on and try, maybe you'll cry, you'll never, never, never know

[Chorus]
There'll be no more one more time
Baby I might be crazy but Ill never call you baby anymore
You had your last second chance at this old heart of mine
And there'll be no more one more time
