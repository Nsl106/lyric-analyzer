[Verse 1]
In a little dancehall just outside of Dallas
I dropped my drink when she came walking by
By the time I got a grip, she slipped through my fingertips
And left me with my big mouth open wide

[Chorus]
I should've asked her faster, but I waited too long
In a red hot minute, like a flash she was gone
I didn't get her number, I never got her name
A natural disaster, I should've asked her faster

[Verse 2]
She was talking to some cowboy in the corner
My one last chance to ask her on the floor
And just when I got the nerve, I got just what I deserve
As I watched him waltzing her right out the door

[Chorus]
I should've asked her faster, but I waited too long
In a red hot minute, like a flash she was gone
I didn't get her number, I never got her name
A natural disaster, I should've asked her faster

[Bridge]
Well there she goes, I just missed
Don't take no rocket scientist
To figure out, when I go home
I'll be there all alone

[Chorus]
I should've asked her faster, but I waited too long
In a red hot minute, like a flash she was gone
I didn't get her number, I never got her name
A natural disaster, I should've asked her faster
