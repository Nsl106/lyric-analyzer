[Verse 1]
That beer ain't gettin' any colder
And I don't know who it's waitin' for
You keep checkin' over your shoulder
Like somebody's 'bout to walk through the door

[Pre-Chorus]
And yeah, I bet he's got a real good excuse
But right now, I wouldn't wanna be in his boots
I'm lookin' at what he's got to lose
Sittin' all alone tonight, look

[Chorus]
I ain't sayin' I'm an angel, baby if you can't tell
No, I ain't the take-you-home-to-mama type
And I ain't sayin' he's a bad guy, all I know is that guy
Must've up and lost his mind tonight
'Cause you're down to the ice in that drink
He didn't buy, I'm here and he's MIA
That ain't no kinda love, I ain't sayin' I'm the one
I'm just sayin' he sure as hell ain't
He sure as hеll ain't (He sure as hell ain't)
(Hе sure as hell ain't)

[Verse 2]
Judgin' by the way you just smiled
I ain't tellin' you nothin' you don't already know
He let you down, but here's the upside
I can give your move on somewhere to go

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't tryin' change that Ms. to a Mrs
But he don't know what he's missin', girl, listen

[Chorus]
I ain't sayin' I'm an angel, baby if you can't tell
No, I ain't the take-you-home-to-mama type
And I ain't sayin' he's a bad guy, all I know is that guy
Must've up and lost his mind tonight
'Cause you're down to the ice in that drink
He didn't buy, I'm here and he's MIA
That ain't no kinda love, I ain't sayin' I'm the one
I'm just sayin' he sure as hell ain't
He sure as hell ain't
He sure as hell ain't

[Bridge]
Yeah, I bet he's got a real good excuse
But right now, I wouldn't wanna be in his boots
I'm lookin' at what he's got to lose
Sittin' all alone tonight, look

[Chorus]
I ain't sayin' I'm an angel, baby if you can't tell
No, I ain't the take-you-home-to-mama type
And I ain't sayin' he's a bad guy, all I know is that guy
Must've up and lost his mind tonight
'Cause you're down to the ice in that drink
He didn't buy, I'm here and he's MIA
That ain't no kinda love, I ain't sayin' I'm the one
I'm just sayin' he sure as hell ain't
He sure as hell ain't

[Outro]
(He sure as hell ain't)
(He sure as hell ain't)
(He sure as hell ain't)
(He sure as hell ain't)
