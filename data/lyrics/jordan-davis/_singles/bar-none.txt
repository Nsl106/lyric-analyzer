[Verse 1]
If it weren't your tires leavin' me in the dust
If you weren't the kind that you only find once
Then the burn of this bourbon wouldn't be hurtin' so bad
Yeah, you were for certain the best thing I ever had

[Chorus]
Bar, none
Now I'm gettin' goner than your long-gone boots
Nothin' I'm workin' on works on you
I've been breakin' every bottle open
Doin' what a banged up, broken heart does
I'm gonna need three or four more
Baby, if a movin' on had a scoreboard
It'd say, "You and your memory, one"
"Me and this bar, none"
"Me and this bar, me and this bar, none"

[Verse 2]
Yeah, me and them bottles up on that shelf
Never had a problem gettin' over anyone else
Lowest low I ever had's right now
No doubt, hands down

[Chorus]
Bar, none
Now I'm gettin' goner than your long-gone boots
Nothin' I'm workin' on works on you
I've been breakin' every bottle open
Doin' what a banged up, broken heart does
I'm gonna need three or four more
Baby, if a movin' on had a scoreboard
It'd say, "You and your memory, one"
"Me and this bar, none"
"Me and this bar, me and this bar, none"

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'm puttin' ninety to the test
Damn, I still don't miss you less
Bet tomorrow's hangover
Is gonna be the worst one yet

[Chorus]
Bar, none
Now I'm gettin' goner than your long-gone boots
Nothin' I'm workin' on works on you
I've been breakin' every bottle open
Doin' what a banged up, broken heart does
Gonna need three or four more
Baby, if a movin' on had a scoreboard
It'd say, "You and your memory, one"
"Me and this bar, none"
"Me and this bar, me and this bar, none"

[Outro]
"Me and this bar, me and this bar, none"
