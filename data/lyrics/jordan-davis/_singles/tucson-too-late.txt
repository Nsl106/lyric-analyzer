[Verse 1]
I didn't know if we were over or just on the rocks
Was me thinking I can save us just a mirage?
I was burning up the highway, it kept getting longer
With every turn of these tires, she just kept getting goner

[Pre-Chorus]
And the sky was showing no signs of rain
Ain’t nothing delaying that plane

[Chorus]
I'm racing through the desert
Thinking I can catch her
But losing ground in this Chevrolet
And that 747 somewhere between here and heaven
And heaven knows I let her slip away
I showеd up and she's gone
Guess I got to Tucson too latе

[Verse 2]
I wonder if she sat there stirring vodka with a straw
Was she counting down the seconds or maybe having second thoughts?
And was moving on made up in her mind?
Would she have changed it if she knew that I

[Chorus]
Was racing through the desert
Thinking I can catch her
But losing ground in this Chevrolet?
And that 747 somewhere between here and heaven
And heaven knows I let her slip away
I showed up and she’s gone
Guess I got to Tucson too late, oh

[Bridge]
Now she's on some silver wings flying
And me I'm on the bad side of good timing, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm racing through the desert
Thinking I can catch her
But losing ground in this Chevrolet (Chevrolet)
That 747 somewhere between here and heaven
And heaven knows I let her slip away (Slip away)
I showed up and she's gone
Guess I waited too long
Like a sad country song
Damn, I got to Tucson too late

[Outro]
(Tucson too late)
Too late
Oh, I got to Tucson too late
