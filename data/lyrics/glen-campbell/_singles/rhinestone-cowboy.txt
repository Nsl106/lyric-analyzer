[Verse 1]
I've been walkin' these streets so long
Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain

[Pre-Chorus]
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

[Chorus]
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

[Verse 2]
Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's taking the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe

[Pre-Chorus]
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

[Chorus]
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

[Outro]
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know
Like a rhinestone cowboy
