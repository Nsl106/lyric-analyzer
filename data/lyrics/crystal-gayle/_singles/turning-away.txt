None of your friends come near you
They've given up trying to steer you
Because you're turning away
Turning away from love

Lately you look so ragged
The edge of your heart's become jagged
And your turning away, turning away from love

(chorus)
I see ya turning away, turning away from love
I see ya turning away, turning away from love

Well she gives it to you without asking
A piece of her heart everlasting
But you're turning away, turning away from love

Just when this old world needs all the love it can get
You're turning away
You're turning away
From the one who really cares
Turning away from love
