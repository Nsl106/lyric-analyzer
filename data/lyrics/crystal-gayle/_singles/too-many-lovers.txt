You gotta be rough, you gotta be tough
If you're gonna fall in love these days
You gotta keep an eye open all the time
Or you'll get your heart broke along the way

These days too many lovers
These days not enough love
These days so much danger
To be aware of

Games and lies, lies and games
Made up faces with counterfeit names
Too many lovers
Not enough love these days

It's gonna take time if your gonna find
The perfect kind of love that you dream about
It's out there on the street but everyone you meet
Won't always tell the truth so you better watch out

These days too many lovers
These days not enough love
These days so much danger
To be aware of

Games and lies, lies and games
Made up faces with counterfeit names
Too many lovers
Not enough love these days

Each night, all night
At night it's a brand new dance
That love, your love, true love is bound to change
There's too many lovers

You gotta be rough, you gotta be tough
If you're gonna fall in love these days
You gotta keep an eye open all the time
Or you'll get your heart broke along the way

These days too many lovers
These days not enough love
These days so much danger
To be aware of

Games and lies, lies and games
Made up faces with counterfeit names
Too many lovers
Not enough love these days

Too many lovers
Not enough love these days
Too many lovers
Not enough love these days

Too many lovers
Not enough love these days
Too many, too many lovers
Too many, too many lovers
