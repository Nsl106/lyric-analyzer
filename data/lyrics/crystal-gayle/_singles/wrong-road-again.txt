[Verse 1]
I can't seem to learn not to love you
You get to me every time
You're someone I just can't say no to
And you're so good at changin' my mind

[Chorus]
Here I go down that wrong road again
Goin' back where I've already been
Even knowin' where it will end
Here I go down that wrong road again

[Verse 2]
Though I see the web that you're weavin'
You and your soft easy lines
Before I stop to think, I'm believin'
And I'm fallin' for you one more time

[Chorus]
Here I go down that wrong road again
Goin' back where I've already been
Even knowin' where it will end
Here I go down that wrong road again

[Chorus]
Here I go down that wrong road again
Goin' back where I've already been
Even knowin' where it will end
Here I go down that wrong road again

[Outro]
Here I go down that wrong road again
Goin' back where I've already been
