[Verse 1]
I've got to tell you I've been rackin' my brain
Hopin' to find a way out
I've had enough of this continual rain
Changes are comin', no doubt

[Chorus]
It's been a too long time
With no peace of mind
And I'm ready for the times
To get better

[Verse 2]
You seem to want from me what I cannot give
I feel so lonesome at times
I have a dream that I wish I could live
It's burnin' holes in my mind

[Chorus]
It's been a too long time
With no peace of mind
And I'm ready for the times
To get better

[Bridge]
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na

[Chorus]
It's been a too long time
With no peace of mind
And I'm ready for the times
To get better
