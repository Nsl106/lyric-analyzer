[Verse 1]
Three o'clock in the morning
And it looks like it's gonna be
Another sleepless night
I've been listening to your dreams
And getting very low
Wondering what I can do

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm being foolish
'Cause I haven't heard you mention
Anybody's name at all
How I wish I could be sure
It's me that turns you on
Each time you close your eyes
I've heard it said that dreamers never lie

[Chorus]
You've been talking in your sleep
Sleeping in your dreams
With some sweet lover
Holding on so tight
Loving her the way
You used to love me
Talking in your sleep
With loving on your mind

[Verse 3]
Maybe I'm being foolish
'Cause I haven't heard you mention
Anybody's name at all
How I wish I could be sure
It's me that turns you on
Each time you close your eyes
I've heard it said that dreamers never lie

[Chorus]
You've been talking in your sleep
Sleeping in your dreams
With some sweet lover
Holding on so tight
Loving her the way
You used to love me
Talking in your sleep
With loving on your mind
