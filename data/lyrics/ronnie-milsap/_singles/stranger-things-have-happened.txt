I keep talking to your picture
But a smile is all you say
It's a lonely conversation
But missing you is easier this way

Last night a shadow filled the doorway
And I heard footsteps on the stairs
Then I woke up this morning
And thought I saw you standing there

Stranger things have happened
And I'll always believe
If stranger things can happen
You could still come back to me

One touch is worth a thousand pictures
What might have been ain't worth a dime
I just hope someday I'll hold you
Another place, some other time

Stranger things have happened
And I'll always believe
If stranger things can happen
You could still come back to me

If stranger things can happen
You could still come back to me

Stranger things have happened...
