I've got some friends down in Houston
Who know me quite well
They'll be more than happy to put me up for a spell
I can hang out or hide out whichever I choose
They won't ask me questions about why I've got the blues

I've got a Houston solution in mind
All it takes is a call on the telephone line
And I can leave all these problems in Nashville behind
I've got a Houston solution in mind

Well, my Daddy once told me you can't run away
Your troubles will follow and find you some day
There's no need to argue cause he's probably right
But I've run out of options and I'm leaving tonight

I've got a Houston solution in mind
All it takes is a call on the telephone line
And I can leave all these problems in Nashville behind
I've got a Houston solution in mind

I've got a Houston solution in mind
I've got a Houston solution...
