Have you ever felt like every eye's on you
Well, that's the way I feel when you walk into a room
And have you ever felt like making love all day
Well, that's the way I feel when you're loving me this way

And I wonder what it is to feel like you
To know someone worships every thing you do
Oh, and even though I know your love is true, yes I do
Sometimes I wonder if you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you?

Have you ever loved so much it hurt inside
Well, that's the only way my love can be described
And have you ever known how cold this world can be?
Well, all I know is how cold it was until you came to me

Oh, and I wonder what it is to feel like you
To know someone worships every thing you do
Oh, and even though I know your love is true, yes I do
Some times I wonder are you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you?

Are you lovin' me like I'm lovin' you?
Are you lovin' me like I'm lovin' you?
Are you lovin' me like I'm lovin' you?
Oh, I wonder, are you lovin' me like I'm lovin' you?
Oh, I wonder?...
