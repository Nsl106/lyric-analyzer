[Verse 1]
Once in every life
Someone comes along
And you came to me
It was almost like a song

[Verse 2]
You were in my arms
Right where you belong
And we were so in love
It was almost like a song

[Bridge]
January through December
We had such a perfect year
Then the flame became a dying ember
All at once you weren't here

[Verse 3]
Now my broken heart
Cries for you each night
And it's almost like a song
But it's much too sad to write

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Now my broken heart
Cries for you each night (Cries for you each night)
And it's almost like a song (Almost like a song)
But it's much too sad to write
It's too sad to write
