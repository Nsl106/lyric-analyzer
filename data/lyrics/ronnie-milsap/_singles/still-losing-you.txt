It came to me again tonight
Here in this smoky place
Suddenly a fleeting memory
In the image of your face

So I paid for my check, buttoned my coat
Stepped into an evening rain
Made my way down the avenue
Softly whispering your name

Still losing you, still losing you
Something inside of me
Keeps hanging on even though you're gone
Still losing you, oh, I'm still losing you

I dialed your number long distance
I heard a stranger say
The party you have tried to reach
Has recently moved away

I was a fool for leaving you
When you needed me so much
Now I'm the victim of a restless heart
That refuses to forget your touch

Still losing you, still losing you
Something inside of me just keeps hanging on
Even though you're gone
Still losing you, oh, I'm still losing you

Maybe someday I'll learn
To live with this regret
Till then my heart will go on
Trying to forget

That I'm still losing you, still losing you
Something inside of me keeps hanging on
Even though you're gone
Still losing you, oh, I'm still losing you...
