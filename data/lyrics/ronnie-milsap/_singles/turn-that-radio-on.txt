Just another night, just another party
I never dreamed that you would be here
Let's don't try to talk, let's don't say we're sorry
All I wanna do is just hold you near

We could be dancin' in the dark
We could be dancin' heart to heart
So let the music start

Chorus:
Somebody turn that radio on I can't stand it
I wanna hear a love song and dance real slow
Somebody turn the jukebox up I demand it
Baby hold me close

I remember what it's like to dance with you all night
Baby it felt so good back then
Who was right or wrong, does it really matter
I just wanna be back in your arms again

I wanna glide across the floor
And feel you next to me once more
Just like it was before

Chorus:
Somebody turn that radio on I can't stand it
I wanna hear a love song and dance real slow
Somebody turn the jukebox up I demand it
Baby hold me close

Oh yeah
--- Instrumental ---
My my my my baby

We could be dancin' in the dark
We could be dancin' heart to heart
So let the music start

Chorus:
Somebody turn that radio on I can't stand it
I wanna hear a love song and dance real slow
Somebody turn the jukebox up I demand it
Baby hold me close

Chorus:
Somebody turn that radio on I can't stand it
I wanna hear a love song and dance real slow
Somebody turn the jukebox up I demand it
Baby hold me close

Somebody turn that radio on
I can't stand it
Oh, dance with me all night long...
