You make my eyes run over all the time
You're happy when I'm out of my mind
You don't love me but you won't let me be
Don't you ever get tired of hurting me?

You must think I look bad with a smile
For you havm't let me wear one in such a long, long while
Still I keep coming back, how can this be
Don't you ever get tired of hurting me?
