When you walked out on me
In walked the misery
And he's been here since then

I don't have plans and schemes
I don't have hopes and dreams
I, I, I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
(since I don't have you)

I don't have fond desires
And I don't have happy hours
No, I don't have anything
Since I don't have you

I don't have Happiness and I guess
I never will ever again
When you walked out on me
In walked the misery
And he's been here since then

I don't have love to share
I don't have one who cares
No, I don't have anything
Since I don't have you!

When you walked out on me
In walked old misery
And he's been here since then

I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you-oooo!

You-oooo!
You-oooo!
You-oooo!
