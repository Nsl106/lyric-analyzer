[Verse 1]
You pull over and I jump in
Into your little red Mercedes Benz
Well, I know there's no turning back
Well, I don't even care where we are
I just want to be inside your car

[Pre-Chorus]
You can drive me wild, baby
You can drive me crazy
You just drive me, I don't care with you

[Chorus]
I'll go anywhere, clean out of sight
Once around the moon, holdin' on tight
Take me by the hand, pull me by the heart
With you, with you, I'll go anywhere

[Verse 2]
Well, in the fast lane or a Sunday drive
Anywhere we go, I'll be fine
Just as long as I'm with you
It don't matter when we get back
This ain't the time to talk about that

[Pre-Chorus]
You can drive me wild, baby
You can drive me crazy
You just drive me, I don't care with you

[Chorus]
I'll go anywhere, clean out of sight
Once around the moon, holdin' on tight
Take me by the hand, pull me by the heart
With you, with you, I'll go anywhere

[Bridge]
If you take me, I will go with you anywhere
Well, I don't know if you know we're goin' somewhere
Goin' somewhere, goin' somewhere

[Pre-Chorus]
You can drive me wild, baby
You can drive me crazy
You just drive me, I don't care with you

[Chorus]
I'll go anywhere, clean out of sight
Once around the moon, holdin' on tight
Take me by the hand, pull me by the heart
With you, with you, I'll go anywhere
