[Verse 1]
I keep rollin' it over and over
And all the things I want to say
I'll never quit or give up or forget you
My love will stand in the way

[Chorus]
And I don't believe in goodbye
And I believe it takes time
To build something strong, it won't take long
For you to believe in me, just look in my eyes
I don't believe in goodbye

[Verse 2]
Where love goes, we must follow
And let our hearts lead the way
We'll be the last of the true believers
First in love and last to stay

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't believe in goodbye
And I believe it takes time
To build something strong, it won't take long
For you to believe in me, just look in my eyes
I don't believe in goodbye

[Chorus]
I don't believe in goodbye
And I believe it takes time
To build something strong
It won't take long for you to believe in me
Just look in my eyes

[Outro]
I don't believe in goodbye
I don't believe in goodbye
I don't believe in goodbye
I don't believe in goodbye
