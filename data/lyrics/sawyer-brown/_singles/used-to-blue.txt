I got your postcard from Dallas
And you say you wonder if I'm doing alright
I'm glad you still think about us
You don't have to worry now
It hardly ever gets me down

I'm getting used to blue
I'll get used to getting over you
I've been knocked around a time or two
I'm getting used to blue

I'll get me an unlisted number
And I'll draw the curtains
Like there's nobody home
Find me a cloud to sit under
Baby turn the tv on
I gotta have a little fun

I'm getting used to blue
I'll get used to getting over you
I've been knocked around a time or two
I'm getting used to blue

You know it's gonna take some tears
It's gonna take some time to get this feeling I keep by my side oh the way it had to fly

I'm getting used to blue
I'll get used to getting over you
I've been knocked around a time or two
I'm getting used to blue

Used to blue
I'll get used to getting over you
I've been knocked around a time or two
I'm getting used to blue
