[Verse 1]
A dark cloud a-hangin' out over my head
I woke up this morning to an empty bed
Why she left me is hard to say
Well, is this fate or just a bad day?

[Chorus]
Is this bad luck or just bad timin'
Or is it the lies I told? It's hard to say
Can you get back what's gone? They say so
If you get down on your knees and believe and pray
But some prayers are hard to pray
With some things, it's hard to say

[Verse 2]
Thumb up in the air and I'm a-hitchin' a ride
Plenty cars passin', but I'm on the wrong side
If I cross over, will they go my way?
Is this fate or just a bad day?

[Chorus]
Is this bad luck or just bad timin'
Or is it the lies I told? It's hard to say
Can you get back what's gone? They say so
If you get down on your knees and believe and pray
But some prayers are hard to pray
With some things, it's hard to say

[Chorus]
Is this bad luck or just bad timin'
Or is it the lies I told? It's hard to say
Can you get back what's gone? They say so
If you get down on your knees and believe and pray
But some prayers are hard to pray
With some things, it's hard to say
