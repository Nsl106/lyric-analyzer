[Verse 1]
Everybody likes a celebration
Happy music and conversation
I'd be lying if I said I didn't have the blues
In the corner there's a couple dancing
From the kitchen, I can hear them laughing
Oh, I wish I was celebrating too

[Chorus]
I know this night won't last forever
I know the sun is gonna shine sometime
I need some hope for a bright tomorrow
And I know this heart is gonna mend just fine

[Verse 2]
So pardon me for my disposition
I wish I didn't have to sit and listen
They're playing the same old songs on the stereo
She's been lying since the day I met her
I'd be better off to just forget her
Oh, I would rather be lonesome all alone

[Chorus]
And I know this night won't last forever
I know the sun is gonna shine sometime
I need some hope for a bright tomorrow
And I know this heart is gonna mend just fine

[Bridge]
Suddenly there's a strange vibration
From my head to my toe
Filling me with a strange sensation
Somebody's telling me, somebody's saying

[Chorus]
I know this night won't last forever
I know the sun is gonna shine sometime
I need some hope for a bright tomorrow
And I know this heart is gonna mend just fine

[Chorus]
I know this night won't last forever
I know the sun is gonna shine sometime
I need some hope for a bright tomorrow
And I know this heart is gonna mend just fine
