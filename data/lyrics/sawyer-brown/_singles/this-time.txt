[Verse 1]
Sittin' on the front porch, nothing but time
Missed you so bad I'm about to go blind
I've got the window busted and the door kicked in
From the last time we said never again

[Chorus]
But this time I'm going to see you coming
Ain't going to be surprised
Yeah, this time I'm going to know what hit me
Right between the eyes
Just one time I want to think it over
Before we speak our minds
And I know we can make a go this time

[Verse 2]
Well, it's hard and heavy, Lord, day and night
That's the way we love and that's the way we fight
We can't stay together, can't be alone
We can go for good but we don't stay gone

[Chorus]
And this time I'm going to see you coming
Ain't going to be surprised
Yeah, this time I'm going to know what hit me
Right between the eyes
Just one time I want to think it over
Before we speak our minds
I know we can make a go this time

[Chorus]
Yeah, this time I'm going to see you coming
Ain't going to be surprised
Yeah, this time I'm going to know what hit me
Right between the eyes
Just one time I want to think it over
Before we speak our minds
I know we can make a go this time

[Outro]
Yeah, I know we can make a go this time
Yeah, this time
