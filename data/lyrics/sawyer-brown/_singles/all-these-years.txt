[Verse 1]
She likes adventure with security
And more than one man can provide
She planned adventure feeling sure that he
Would not be home 'til after five

[Pre-Chorus]
He turned on the lights and turned them off again
And said the one thing he could say

[Chorus]
All these years, where have I been?
Well, I've been down the road to work and home again
And I'm still here until I'm gone
Don't you rub it in too hard that I've been wrong
All these years

[Verse 2]
She said, "You're not the man you used to be"
And he said, "Neither is this guy"
She said, "There's some things you refuse to see
But I guess sometimes so do I"

[Pre-Chorus]
She made no excuse why she was lying there
She said the one thing she could say

[Chorus]
All these years, what have I done?
I made your supper and your daughter and your son
Still, I'm here and still confused
But I can finally see how much I stand to lose
All these years

[Outro]
I'm still here and so confused
But I can finally see how much I stand to lose
All these years
