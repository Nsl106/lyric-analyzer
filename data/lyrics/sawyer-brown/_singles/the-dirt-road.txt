[Verse 1]
Daddy worked hard for his dollar
He said some folks don't, but that's okay
They won't know which road to follow
Because an easy street might lead you astray

[Chorus]
I'll take the dirt road, it's all I know
I've been a walking it for years
It's gone where I need to go
It ain't easy, it ain't supposed to be
So I'll take my time, and life won't pass me by
'Cause it's right there to find on the dirt road

[Verse 2]
I have lived life in the fast lane
You gotta watch your back and look both ways
When it's said and done, the time we have is borrowed
You better make real sure you're headed the right way

[Chorus]
I'll take the dirt road, it's all I know
I've been a walking it for years
It's gone where I need to go
It ain't easy, it ain't supposed to be
So I'll take my time, and life won't pass me by
'Cause it's right there to find on the dirt road

[Chorus]
I'll take the dirt road, it's all I know
I've been a walking it for years
It's gone where I need to go
It ain't easy, it ain't supposed to be
So I'll take my time, and life won't pass me by
'Cause it's right there to find on the dirt road
