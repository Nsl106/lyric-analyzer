[Verse 1]
Well, I've been called a self-made man
And, girl, don't you believe it's true?
I know exactly how lucky I am
When I'm gettin' this close to you
It's high time I'm givin' some praise
To those that got me where I am today

[Chorus]
I got to thank Mama for the cookin'
Daddy for the whoopin'
The devil for the trouble that I get into
I got to give credit where credit is due
I thank the bank for the money
Thank God for you

[Verse 2]
A strong heart and a willin' hand
That's the secret to my success
A good woman, I try to be a good man
Good job, Lord, I know I've been blessed
I'm just part of a greater plan
It doesn't matter which part I am

[Chorus]
I got to thank Mama for the cookin'
Daddy for the whoopin'
The devil for the trouble that I get into
I got to give credit where credit is due
I thank the bank for the money
Thank God for you

[Chorus]
I got to thank Mama for the teachin'
Daddy for the preachin'
The devil for the trouble that I get into
I got to give credit where credit is due
I thank the bank for the money
Thank God for you

[Post-Chorus]
(Mama, Daddy, the devil)
Yeah, I got to give credit where credit is due
I thank the bank for the money
Thank God for you

[Outro]
I thank Mama, I thank Daddy (The devil)
Well, I got to give credit where credit is due
I thank the bank for the money
Thank God for you
