[Verse 1]
We scratched our names
In that oak tree
'Cause I loved you
And you loved me
A jagged little heart, so the whole town knew it
Carved into the bark with an arrow through it
I came out here to see it one more time

[Chorus]
And I got my chainsaw
Oh, you know it's gotta go, it's such a shame y'all
But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall
And I'm sittin' on a stump
Love is shady, love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holdin' a chainsaw
(Woo!)

[Verse 2]
Well, I guess all those years
They don't mean nothing
Now I can't wait
To count those rings
Nothing left of us but dust and splinters
A big pile of wood to keep me warm through the winter
Because I, I don't have you

[Chorus]
But I got my chainsaw
Oh, you know it's gotta go, it's such a shame y'all
But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall
And I'm sittin' on a stump
Love is shady, love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holdin' a chainsaw
Whoa, oh
Yeah
Just a little ol' chainsaw

[Bridge]
I remember what you said that night
That you would love me for the rest of your life
We wrote "Forever" with a pocketknife
But forever's going down... tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause I got my chainsaw
It's gotta go, it's such a shame doll
But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall
And I'm sitting on a stump
Love is shady, love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Love is shady, love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holding a chainsaw
Chain, chain, chainsaw
(Woo!)

[Outro]
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da (Chain, chain, chainsaw)
Da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da
