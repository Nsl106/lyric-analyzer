[Verse 1]
Would you walk to the edge of the ocean
Just to fill my jar with sand?
Just in case I get the notion
To let it run through my hand
Let it run through my hand

[Chorus]
Well, I don't want the whole world
The sun, the moon, and all their light
I just wanna be the only girl
You love all your life
You love all your life

[Verse 2]
Would you catch a couple thousand fireflies, yeah
And put 'em in a lamp to light my world?
All dressed up in a tux and bow tie
Hand delivered to a lonely girl
To a lonely, lonely girl

[Chorus]
Well, I don't want the whole world
The sun, the moon, and all their light
I just wanna be the only girl
You love all your life
You love all your life

[Bridge]
Lately I've been writing desperate love songs
I mostly sing them to the wall
You could be the center piece of my obsession
If you would notice me at all, yeah, yeah-yeah

[Chorus]
Well, I don't want the whole world, no
The sun, the moon, and all their light
I just wanna be the only girl
You love all your life
You love all your life

[Outro]
You love all your life
Life
Yeah
