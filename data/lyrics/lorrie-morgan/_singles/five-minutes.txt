[Verse 1]
You look so disbelieving
At my suitcase by the door
My taxi's on it's way here
I can't take it anymore

[Verse 2]
Lately you've forgotten
What loving me is about
Well now you've got five minutes
To figure it out

[Chorus]
You've got five minutes
To tell me what I've needed to hear
You've got five minutes
To show me that you're really sincere
That's not much time to change my mind
It'll take a miracle no doubt
And you've got five minutes
To figure it out

[Verse 3]
Now I've got your attention
Here's what I've got to say
You'd better do some talking
'Cause my taxi's on it's way

[Verse 4]
We used to set the nights on fire
Now every day is the same
Well now you've got five minutes
To kindle the flame

[Chorus]
You've got five minutes
To tell me what I've needed to hear
You've got five minutes
To show me that you're really sincere
That's not much time to change my mind
It'll take a miracle no doubt
And you've got five minutes
To figure it out

[Verse 5]
You can start with please don't leave me
And end with I love you
And if you'd only kiss me
The way you used to do, you could see a miracle come true

[Chorus]
You've got five minutes
To tell me what I've needed to hear
You've got five minutes
To show me that you're really sincere
That's not much time to change my mind
It'll take a miracle no doubt
And you've got five minutes
To figure it out

[Outro]
You've still got five minutes to figure it out
