[Verse 1]
Here you are on the porch again
With your hat in your hand and a guilty grin
Baby I ain't gonna fall for that, just because I always have
And I'm not the only one who won't be taken it

[Chorus]
Don't you try to come through my door
I can't watch you leave anymore
When you go we both walk
When you go we both walk
You walk away and I walk the floor

[Verse 2]
Whenever you get that itch to go
You think I just sit and wait at home
But I've walked miles behind these walls
Without getting anywhere at all
And I think I've had enough of going down that road

[Chorus]
Don't you try to come through my door
I can't watch you leave anymore
When you go we both walk
When you go we both walk
You walk away and I walk the floor

[Chorus]
Don't you try to come through my door
I can't watch you leave anymore
When you go we both walk
When you go we both walk
You walk away and I walk the floor
You walk away and I walk the floor
