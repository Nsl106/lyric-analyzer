[Verse 1]
Sir, if you don't mind, I'd rather be alone
From the moment I walked in tonight you've been coming on
If I've told you once, I've told you twice, I'm just here to unwind
I'm not interested in romance, or what you have in mind

[Chorus]
What part of "no" don't you understand?
To put it plain and simple, I'm not into one night stands
I'll be glad to explain it if it's too hard to comprehend
What part of "no" don't you understand?

[Verse 2]
I appreciate the drink, and the rose was nice of you
I don't mean to be so mean, I don't think I'm getting through
No, I don't need no company and I don't wanna dance
So what part of "no" don't you understand?

[Chorus]
What part of "no" don't you understand?
To put it plain and simple, I'm not into one night stands
I'll be glad to explain it if it's too hard to comprehend
What part of "no" don't you understand?

[Outro]
I'll be glad to explain it if it's too hard to comprehend
What part of "no" don't you understand?
What part of "no" don't you understand?
