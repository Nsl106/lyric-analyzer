[Verse 1: Lorrie Morgan]
You borrowed my favorite dress
I borrowed your best perfume
And we're looking good I guess
We've turned every head in the room

[Verse 2: Lorrie Morgan]
But the best thing I've ever seen
Is looking at you
And girl I'd give anything
To be in your shoes

[Chorus: Lorrie Morgan]
'Cause I'd love to be out of your shoes tonight
To be the one turning him on when he turns out the light
Under your skin lying with him when he holds you tight
I'd love to be out of your shoes tonight

[Verse 3: Lorrie Morgan]
He'll buy you some fine champagne
And say things I'd love to hear
My loss will be your gain
And the rest of the picture is clear

[Verse 4: Lorrie Morgan]
I see him taking you home
And closing the door
And I see my favorite dress
Fall to the floor

[Chorus: Lorrie Morgan]
Oh I'd love to be out of your shoes tonight
To be the one turning him on when he turns out the light
Under your skin lying with him when he holds you tight
I'd love to be out of your shoes tonight
I'd love to be out of your shoes tonight
