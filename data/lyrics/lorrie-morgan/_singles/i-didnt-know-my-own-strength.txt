[Verse 1]
I've been livin' with a heart on the mend
Wondering how will I ever be strong
I know I'll live to love again
I just leaned on you too long
It's been an uphill fight
But I'm gonna be alright

[Chorus]
I didn't know my own strength
'Til I had to pick myself up
And carry on without your love
I'm gettin' back on my feet
It's been a long hard fall
But I'll make it after all
No, I didn't know my own strength

[Verse 2]
I've had oceans of tears to get through
And the weight of the world on my mind
There's been mountains of memories to lose
And I've been beating back the blows to my pride
But 'til the times got tough
I never knew what I was made of

[Chorus]
I didn't know my own strength
'Til I had to pick myself up
And carry on without your love
I'm gettin' back on my feet
It's been a long hard fall
But I'll make it after all
No, I didn't know my own strength

[Bridge]
Then the times got tough
And I knew what I was made of

[Chorus]
I didn't know my own strength
'Til I had to pick myself up
And carry on without your love
I'm gettin' back on my feet
It's been a long hard fall
But I'll make it after all
No, I didn't know my own strength
