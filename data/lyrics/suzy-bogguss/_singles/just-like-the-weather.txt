The wind is blowing from a new direction
If you're thinking 'bout going, I know
It's been a long season, and hard on our affections
But that's no reason to let go

You change just like the weather
But the weather you know will always change
If you stay it'll get better
Wherever you go it's bound to rain

So put on your jacket and stand your ground
Love's gonna have its highs and lows
If we turn and face it, the wind will come around
You don't have to chase it when it blows

You change just like the weather
But the weather you know will always change
If you stay it'll get better
Wherever you go it's bound to rain

You change just like the weather
But the weather you know will always change
If you stay it'll get better
Wherever you go it's bound to rain

You change just like the weather...
