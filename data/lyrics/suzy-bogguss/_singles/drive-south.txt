[Verse 1]
I didn't say, we wouldn't hurt anymore
That's how you learn, you just get burned
We don't have to feel like dirt anymore
Though love's not learned, baby it's our turn

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We were always lookin' for true north
With our heads in the clouds, just a little off course
But I left that motor runnin'
Now if you're feelin' down and out

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, drive South
With the one you love
Come on, baby, drive South

[Verse 2]
I'm not talkin' about retreatin', no sir
Gonna take our stand in this Chevy van
Windows open on the rest of the world
Holdin' hands all the way to Dixieland

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We've been tryin' to turn our lives around
Since we were little kids, it's been wearin' us down
Don't turn away now, darlin'
Let's fire it up and wind it out

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, drive South
With the one you love
Come on, baby, drive South

[Bridge]
I heard your momma callin', I think she was only stallin'
Don't know who she's talkin' to, baby, me and you
We can go south with a smile on, ain't gonna pack my nylons
Just leave these legs showin', it gets hot down where were goin'

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We were always lookin' for true north
With our heads in the cloud, just a little off course
But I left that motor runnin'
Now if you're feelin' down and out
Come on, baby, drive

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, drive South
With the one you love
Come on, baby, drive South
With the one you love
Come on, baby, drive South
