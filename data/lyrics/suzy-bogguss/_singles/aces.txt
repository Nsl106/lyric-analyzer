[Verse 1]
My old friend said to me
That I ain't being what I'm supposed to be
Well, I don't know, could be true
I know I wasn't always there for you

[Chorus]
And now you're ready to walk out
You're ready to run
Talk to me, can't you see
I would never wanna do what it seems I've done
You can't deal me the aces and think I wouldn't play
Don't let this be the reason you would walk away

[Verse 2]
The things you think I should do
I've never understood that part of you
You know I've tried to be a friend
But you feel undermined and hurt again

[Chorus]
Now don't let it convince you
Please don't take it to heart
Compromise and realize
You can never really run everything you start
You can't deal me the aces and think I wouldn't play
Don't let this be the reason you would walk away

[Bridge]
And I guess I said I couldn't see
How things could turn out like they've come to be
And if I lied, and if I knew
I was only trying to think of you

[Chorus]
And now you're ready to walk out
You're ready to run
Talk to me, can't you see
I would never wanna do what it seems I've done
You can't deal me the aces and think I wouldn't play
Don't let this be the reason you would walk away
Don't let this be the reason you would walk away
