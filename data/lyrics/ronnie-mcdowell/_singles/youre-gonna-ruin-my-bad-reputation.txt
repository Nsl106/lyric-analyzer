You're gonna ruin my bad reputation
They say my crazy days are through
It's all over town
I'm settling down
All I'm crazy about is you

There's a bartender down at the Starlight Lounge
Probably wondering where I've been
Cause every Saturday night
He broke up the fight and sometimes he let me win

Well, he would sure be shocked
If he could see me sipping ice tea and watching TV
It's Saturday night
And I'm taking it easy home alone with you

You're gonna ruin my bad reputation
With the good love that you're giving me
I used to be a hell raiser
A heart breaker
Foot loose and fancy free

You're gonna ruin my bad reputation
They say my crazy days are through
It's all over town
I'm settling down
All I'm crazy about is you

I know the desk clerk well at the Paradise Motel
And he calls me Mr. Smith
When ever I check in
He winks and grins at the latest Mrs Smith I'm with

Now he probably won't believe it's true
When he hears I gave a ring to you
Cause there'll be no more motel rendezvous for this Mr. Smith

You're gonna ruin my bad reputation
With the good love that you're giving me
I used to be a hell raiser
A heart breaker
Foot loose and fancy free

You're gonna ruin my bad reputation
They say my crazy days are through
It's all over town
I'm settling down
All I'm crazy about is you

It's all over town
I'm settling down
All I'm crazy about is you
