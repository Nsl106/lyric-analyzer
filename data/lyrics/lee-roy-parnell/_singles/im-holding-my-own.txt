[Verse 1]
You said the only thing harder than sayin goodbye
Was sayin hello after all this time
When I ran into you with your new love in tow
You said you're worried about me and you wanna know
How'm I getting by

[Chorus]
Thank you, I'm holdin' my own
Don't you worry 'bout me no more
It hurt me when you left me alone
But there's two sides to every door
And the life you left behind has led to lives I'd have never known
So thank you, I'm holdin' my own

[Verse 2]
Your new love walked on up while we said goodbye
You took my hand and you caught my eye
Told me there's a chance for another try
You would love to hear from me some sweet time
I guess you didn't understand

[Chorus]
Thank you, I'm holdin' my own
Don't you worry 'bout me no more
It hurt me when you left me alone
But there's two sides to every door
And the life you left behind has led to lives I'd have never known
So thank you, I'm holdin' my own

[Bridge]
There's a lesson I learned
When the love stays true
If you look long enough
You'll find the one who's lookin' for you

[Chorus]
Right now I'm holdin' my own
Don't you worry 'bout me no more
It hurt me when you left me alone
But there's two sides to every door
And the life you left behind has led to lives I'd have never known
So thank you, I'm holdin' my own

Thank you, I'm holdin' my own
