[Verse 1]
Here you come knocking on my door
When you said you don't need me anymore
Do you really think I'm crazy enough
To go throwing my good heart after bad love

[Chorus]
What kind of fool do you think I am
I ain't falling for you all over again
I ain't playing a game that I know I can't win
What kind of fool do you think I am

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I was lost in your love and I got burned
You hurt me one time I finally learned
So now that I know what your loving can do
Who do you think you're talking to

[Chorus]
What kind of fool do you think I am
I ain't falling for you all over again
I ain't playing a game that I know I can't win
What kind of fool do you think I am

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Falling in love with you
Just brought me sorrow
You'll leave me smiling tonight
But crying tomorrow

[Verse 3]
So don't you come knocking on my door
'Cause you know I don't need you anymore
Now do you really think I'm crazy enough
To go throwing my good heart after bad love

[Chorus]
What kind of fool do you think I am
I ain't falling for you all over again
I ain't playing a game that I know I can't win
What kind of fool do you think I am

[Chorus]
What kind of fool do you think I am
I ain't falling for you all over again
I ain't playing a game that I know I can't win
What kind of fool do you think I am

[Tag]
Oh, what kind of fool do you think I am
