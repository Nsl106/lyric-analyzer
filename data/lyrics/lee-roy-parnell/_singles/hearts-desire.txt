I can't think straight
Girl you're always on my mind
It's keepin' me up late
Can't even get to work on time

Got a fever burnin' up inside
I see your face each time I close my eyes

You're my heart's desire, always thinking of you
Heart's desire, girl I want you so bad
Like a car spinnin' out of control with a blown out
Tire
You're my heart's desire, I do believe I love you
Heart's desire, best I never had
Got a yearning down deep and I don't want to put out
The fire
Cause you're my heart's desire

You walk by I can barely speak your name
You bat your eye and my courage goes down the drain
My chest is poundin' and I must confess

Girl, you're givin' me a cardiac arrest

You're my heart's desire, always thinking of you
Heart's desire, girl I want you so bad
Like a car spinnin' out of control with a blown out
Tire
You're my heart's desire, I do believe I love you
Heart's desire, best I never had
Got a yearning down deep and I don't want to put out
The fire
Cause you're my heart's desire

Like a sweet tooth craving candy
I got such a longing I can hardly stand it

You're my heart's desire, I do believe I love you
Heart's desire, best I never had
Got a yearning down deep and I don't want to put out
The fire
Cause you're my heart's desire
