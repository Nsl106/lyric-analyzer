The bills are all due
The babies need shoes
I'm busted
Cotton is down to a quarter a pound
I'm busted

Got a cow that's gone dry
Hen that won't lay
A big stack of bills get bigger each day
The county gonna haul my belongings away
I'm busted

I called brother Bill to ask for a loan
I was busted
Lord, I hate to beg like a dog for a bone
I'm busted

My brother said
There ain't a thing I can do
My wife and my kids
They're all down with the flu
I was just thinkin' of callin' on you
I'm busted

Now Lord, I'm no thief
But I could go wrong
I'm so busted
The food that we canned last summer is gone
I'm busted

The fields are all bare
The cotton won't grow
Me and my family's gotta pack up and go
Where I'll make a living
Lord only knows
I'm busted

Where I'll make a living
Lord only knows
I'm busted
