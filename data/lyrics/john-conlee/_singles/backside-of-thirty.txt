[Verse 1]
Making money at thirty with a wife and a son
Then a short five years later, it all comes undone
She's gone back to mama with the boy by her side
Now I'm wine drunk and running with them on my mind

[Chorus]
I'm on the backside of thirty and back on my own
An empty apartment don't feel like a home
On the backside of thirty, the short side of time
Back on the bottom with no will to climb

[Verse 2]
It's dawn Monday morning and I just called in sick
I skipped work last Friday to drink this month's rent
And when my friends ask me, I tell 'em I'm fine
But my eyes tell a story that my lies can't hide

[Chorus]
I'm on the backside of thirty and back on my own
An empty apartment don't feel like a home
On the backside of thirty, the short side of time
Back on the bottom with no will to climb
