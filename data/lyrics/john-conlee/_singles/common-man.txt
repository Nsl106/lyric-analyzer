[Verse 1]
As the maid poured wine and we prepared to dine
I knew I was feelin' out of place
At a table as large as a river barge
And "I love you" written all on your face
I appreciate your hospitality
But I wish that we would go
Let me drive us to McDonald's and I'll talk to you
Concernin' somethin' you should really know

[Chorus]
I'm just a common man, drive a common van
My dog ain't got a pedigree
If I have my say, it's gonna stay that way
'Cause high-browed people lose their sanity
And a common man is what I'll be

[Verse 2]
I'll take a Chevrolet just any day
So give your daddy back his Mercedes Benz
And there's some common people that I hang out with
They're my good time buddies, they're my friends
And I'd rather chug-a-lug a mug of Budweiser beer
Than sip a crystal glass of wine
So won't you make your mind up to believe in me
And leave this high livin' world behind

[Chorus]
I'm just a common man, drive a common van
My dog ain't got a pedigree
If I have my say, it's gonna stay that way
'Cause high-browed people lose their sanity
And a common man is what I'll be

[Bridge]
Yes, I'm happy just being free
And I'm happy just being me
And I hope that you will see

[Chorus]
I'm just a common man, drive a common van
My dog ain't got a pedigree
If I have my say, it's gonna stay that way
'Cause high-browed people lose their sanity
And a common man is what I'll be
