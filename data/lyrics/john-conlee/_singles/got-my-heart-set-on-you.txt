[Verse 1]
Ever since the day I met you
I feel like I'm walking on air
And lately I'm convinced, it's no coincidence
I've run into you everywhere
And though I've heard your love is taken
I gotta believe what's in your eyes
Would I be out of line if I suggested a time
And we get together one of these nights

[Chorus]
Got my heart set on you
You're everything I ever wanted
Got my heart set on you
Can't be anything but love, baby, I'm bettin' on it

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I'm not the kind who rushes in
But baby, every time I see you
Before I even leave you
I can hardly wait to see you again

[Chorus]
Got my heart set on you
You're everything I ever wanted
Got my heart set on you
Can't be anything but love, baby, I'm bettin' on it

[Bridge]
I don't mean to be comin' on strong
Or taking anything for granted
Love is a thing that just comes along
You don't understand how it got outta hand
But you're in it right from the start

[Chorus]
Got my heart set on you
You're everything I ever wanted
Got my heart set on you
It can't be anything but love, baby, I'm bettin' on it

[Outro]
Got my heart set on you
You're everything I ever wanted
Got my heart set on you
It can't be anything but love, baby, I'm bettin' on it
