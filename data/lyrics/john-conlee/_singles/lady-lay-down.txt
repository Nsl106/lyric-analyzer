[Verse 1]
Too many times I didn't try to hold you
I never kept the promises I told you
Now it's time I give in, I know
To the words that I should have said long ago

[Chorus]
Lady lay down beside me
Wrap all your love around me
I need you to stay
Don't turn away from me now
Lady lay down

[Verse 2]
You've been alone, I guess I've known about it
You gave me love and learned to live without it
Now that you've turned to go
Let me beg you to stay the best way I know

[Chorus]
Lady lay down beside me
Wrap all your love around me
I need you to stay
Don't turn away from me now
Lady lay (down)
Lady lay down beside me
Wrap all your love around me
I need you to stay
Don't turn away from me now
Lady lay down

[Outro]
Lady lay down
