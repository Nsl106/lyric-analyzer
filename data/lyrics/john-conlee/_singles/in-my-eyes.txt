Shes just a woman
A hundred pounds of flesh and blood
Quick with a smile warm with a touch for me
Shes just a woman
And not the least or the most desired
But she sets one man's heart on fire
And its me that she wants to please

And in my eyes
God never made a more beautiful girl
In my eyes
Theres no one more lovely in all of the world
And she looks at me at times with such surprise
When she sees how special she is in my eyes

Shes only human
And she cries sometimes when she looks in the mirror
And counts a new line that seemed to appear overnight
Shes only human
Its not that shes vain, shes just afraid
That therell come a time when Ill turn away at the sight
But I swear that's not right

And in my eyes
She just grows lovelier to me
And in my eyes
Shes only aging gracefully
And a thousand strands of gray won't disguise
The woman shell always be in my eyes

Sometimes she makes mistakes
But I'm aware of her faults
Her moods go up and down
But that's just because
Shes just a woman
And giving her love to only me
Without her help I would be less of a man
Than she thinks I am

And in my eyes
Love never changes or pretends
In my eyes
Her mystery never ends
And everything I feel as years go by
Makes her love grow sweeter still in my eyes
In my eyes...
She is my woman
