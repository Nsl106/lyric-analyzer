He's been working all week
He's got mental fatigue
And that old couch sure looks fine
All week he's been gone
She's been sitting alone
Slowly going out of her mind

As he kicks off his shoes for the six o’clock news
She's getting all prettied up
Oh, she's wanting to boogie
He's wanting to lay there
She's got the Friday night blues

And the Friday night blues
They get in your shoes
And they work to get you down
Oh, and there ain't a lady that I ever knew
Who didn't need her a night on the town

But the hills and the bills
And a week's worth of deals
Has got him feeling more than used
Oh, he's kicking his shoes off
She's putting hers on
She's got the Friday night blues

Oh, there once was a time she was top of the line
Her nights like teenage dreams
Now it's operas at noon
Dancing round with her broom
Talking to the washing machine

Oh, the girl down the street
Says her old man is neat
And she makes it sound so true
Now she's feeling lonely
Thinks she's the only one with the Friday night blues

And the Friday night blues
They get in your shoes
And they work to get you down
Oh, and there ain't a lady that I ever knew
Who didn't need her a night on the town

But the hills and the bills
And a week's worth of deals
Has got him feeling more than used
Oh, he's kicking his shoes off
She's putting hers on
She's got the Friday night blues

Oh those Friday night blues
They get in your shoes
And they work to get you down
Oh and there ain't a lady that I ever knew
Who didn't need her a night on the town

But the hills and the bills
And a week's worth of deals
Has got him feeling more than used
Oh, he's kicking his shoes off
She's putting hers on
She's got the Friday night blues
