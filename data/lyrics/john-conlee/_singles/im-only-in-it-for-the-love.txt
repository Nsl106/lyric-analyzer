There's something you got that really gets me going
It's hard to believe the way the feeling's growing
So, let me say before my heart starts showing
I'm only in it for the love

I want you to know you got my full attention
And every move is with my best intention
Before we go on, I thought I ought to mention
I'm only in it for the love

I'm only in it for the love and affection
I think I'm heading in the right direction
I guess the question that I'm really asking
Is do you want a love that's everlasting?

So many times I let my heart get broken
I closed my eyes and left myself wide open
Now I only deal in real emotions
I'm only in it for the love

I'm only in it for the love and affection
I think I'm heading in the right direction
I guess the question that I'm really asking
Is do you want a love that's everlasting?

So many times I let my heart get broken
I closed my eyes and left my heart wide open
And now I only deal in real emotions
I'm only in it for the love, I'm only in it for the love

I'm only in it for the love and affection
I think I'm heading in the right direction
I guess the question that I'm really asking
Is do you want a love that's everlasting?

So many times I let my heart get broken
I closed my eyes and left myself wide open
And now I only deal in real emotions
I'm only in it for the love...
I'm only in it for the love...
I'm only in it for the love
