[Verse 1]
Well, I ain't gonna work today
Just wanna sit around and play
Gonna hit balls off the dock
Kick back in my flip-flops
Don't owe nothin' to the lender
Nothin' spinnin' in the blender
The only thing on my agenda is

[Chorus]
Beers and sunshine
Bonfires and summertime
Back porch nights in South Carolina
Ain't nothin' finer than me and my girl strikin' up a little lighter
'Cause everybody's down in a world gone crazy
Don't know how to fix it but I think maybe
Turn on the good times, turn off the TV
Yeah, the only B.S. I need is beers and sunshine

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna call my girl and say
Let's get our friends and hit the lake
Grab a boat and get to floatin'
A little buzzed and a little toasted
We're gonna hang and have a little fun now
Flying high like we'll never come down
We're gonna roll until we run out of

[Chorus]
Beers and sunshine
Bonfires and summertime
Back porch nights in South Carolina
Ain't nothin' finer than me and my girl strikin' up a little lighter
'Cause everybody's down in a world gone crazy
Don't know how to fix it but I think maybe
Turn on the good times, turn off the TV
Yeah, the only B.S. I need is beers and sunshine
Oh, beers and sunshine, oh

[Chorus]
Beers and sunshine
Bonfires and summertime
Back porch nights in South Carolina
Ain't nothin' finer than me and my girl strikin' up a little lighter
'Cause everybody's down in a world gone crazy
Don't know how to fix it but I think maybe
Turn on the good times, turn off the TV
Yeah, the only B.S. I need is beers and sunshine

[Outro]
Oh, beers and sunshine
Beers and sunshine
Bonfires and summertime, time, time
Oh, oh oh, yeah
