[Verse 1]
Church bells ringing on our wedding day
Climbed in that limo and rode away
Guess you'll always hear some people say
Man, they're never going to make it

We settled in and we settled down
In this quiet little seaside town
You are the rock I built my world around
And life will never break it

[Chorus]
We are one heartbeat in the darkness
We are one lasting answered prayer
We are one unbroken promise
And we are two, true believers

[Verse 2]
It wasn't easy getting here today
Sometimes you stumbled or I lost my way
But every roadblock was a chance to say
Take my hand I'm here beside you

We worked and made it through the toughest parts
Now every day is another chance to start
To look around and see where we are
It's where we were trying to get to

[Chorus]
We are one heartbeat in the darkness
We are one lasting answered prayer
We are one unbroken promise
And we are two, true believers

[Verse 3]
We are one before our God in Heaven
Oh, we are one road when the going gets rough
We are one now and forever
We are one name, one life, one flame

[Chorus]
We are one heartbeat in the darkness
We are one lasting answered prayer
We are one unbroken promise
And we are two, true believers
