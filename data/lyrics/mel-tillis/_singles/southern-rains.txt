[Verse 1]
Sometimes my soul gets weary and my mind begins to wander
And like that old train "The Hummingbird" it goes to Alabam
They say home is where the heart is and mine is down in Dixie
And when you go down to Dixie, you're heading for higher ground

[Chorus]
(Southern rain)
Blowing from the coast of Mississippi
(Southern rain)
I fell better when those southern waters hit me
I can't get into Jordan seven times to ease the pain
But I can pray for help and hope for southern rain
(Southern rain)
Like the sunshine it's a blessing sent from heaven
(Southern rain)
They can wash away your cares if you let them
You may not believe my story and you may think I'm insane
But they're the closest thing to home those southern rains

[Verse 2]
Homesick is a feeling that a body can't get over
There's no such thing as healing and it won't go away with time
When were young we want to get away when we're old we want to go back
And we spend our lives replacing all the things we leave behind

[Chorus]
(Southern rain)
Blowing from the coast of Mississippi
(Southern rain)
I fell better when those southern waters hit me
I can't get into Jordan seven times to easy the pain
But I can pray for help and hope for southern rain
(Southern rain)
Like the sunshine it's a blessing sent from heaven
(Southern rain)
They can wash away your cares if you let them
You may not believe my story and you may think I'm insane
But they're the closest thing to home those southern rains
