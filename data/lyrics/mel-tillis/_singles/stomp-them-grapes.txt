Stomp, stomp them grapes and make that wine
Put it in a bottle, boys, and ship it on down the line

Well, I got up this morning and made it downtown
Started mighty early just makin' my rounds
Well, I had me a woman she left me alone
I got to lose these blues before I take myself back home

So stomp, stomp them grapes and make that wine
Put it in a bottle, boys, and ship it on down the line
I said stomp, stomp them grapes and make that wine
'Cause there's a trouble man in trouble with a woman on his mind

Yesterday she loved me, today it's history
Why she should want to leave me is a deep dark mystery
I may not find the answer but I find me a jug
'Cause I'm gonna do some drinkin', boys, it's really got me fog

So stomp, stomp them grapes and make that wine
Put it in a bottle, boys, and ship it on down the line
I said stomp, stomp them grapes and make that wine
There's a trouble man in trouble with a woman
