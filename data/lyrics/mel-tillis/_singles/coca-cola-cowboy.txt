[Verse 1]
I called collect on the phone
You say you're tired and alone
But it sounds like someone else is lying there
She said, "Don't call me no more
I've changed the locks on my door
It's too late now, I know you'll never change
And she said...

[Chorus]
You're just a Coca Cola cowboy
You got an Eastwood smile and a Robert Redford hair
But you walked across my heart like it was Texas
You taught me how to say I just don't care

[Verse 2]
She said, just leave me alone
And let me hang up this phone
'Cause he'll see me cry, and think I still love you
She said don't call me no more
I've changed the locks on my door
It's too late now and I hope you understand
And she said...

[Chorus]
You're just a Coca Cola cowboy
You got an Eastwood smile and a Willie Nelson hair
But you walked across my heart like it was Texas
Taught me how to say I just don't care (Haha)

[Bridge]
And she said...

[Chorus]
You're just a Coca Cola cowboy
You got an Eastwood smile and a Porter Wagoner hair
But you walked across my heart like it was Texas
You taught me how to say I just don't care
Yeah, you walked across my heart like it was Texas
You taught me how to say I just don't care

[Outro]
Yeah, thank you so much
