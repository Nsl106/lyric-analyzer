[Chorus]
Well, I ain't never, I ain't never
Seen nobody like you, no, no, no
Never have I ever
Seen nobody like you

[Verse 1]
Lord, you call me up and say, "Meet me at nine
I'll have to hurry, hurry, but I'm there on time
I walk right up and I knock on your door
The landlord says, "She ain't a-here no more"

[Chorus]
I ain't never, oh, darlin'
Seen nobody like you, woop-woop
But I love you, god, I love you, girl
I love you just the same

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, you tell me sweet things that you don't mean
You got me living in a haunted dream
You make me do things I don't wanna do
My friends ask me, "Tillis, what's wrong with you"

[Chorus]
I ain't never, oh, darlin'
Seen nobody like you, woop-woop
But I love you, god, I love you, girl
I love you just the same
Love you just the same
Love you just the same
