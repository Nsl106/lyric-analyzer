[Verse 1]
Mile upon mile got no direction
We're all playing the same game
We're all looking for redemption
We're just afraid to say the name
So caught up now in pretending
What we're seeking is the truth
I'm just looking for a happy ending
All I'm looking for is you

[Chorus]
And it came upon me wave on wave
You're the reason I'm still here, yeah
Am I the one you were sent to save?
And it came upon me wave on wave

[Verse 2]
I wandered out into the water
And I thought that I might drown
I don't know what I was after
Just know I was going down
That's when she found me
Not afraid anymore
She said you know I always had you baby
Just waiting for you to find what you were looking for

[Chorus]
And it came upon me wave on wave
You're the reason I'm still here, yeah
Am I the one you were sent to save
And it came upon me wave on wave

[Interlude]
Wave on wave, wave on wave

[Chorus]
And it came upon me wave on wave
You're the reason I'm still here, yeah
Am I the one you were sent to save?
And it came upon me wave on wave

[Verse 3]
The clouds broke and the angels cried
You ain't gotta walk alone
That's why they put me in your way
And it came upon me wave on wave

[Chorus]
And it came upon me wave on wave
You're the reason I'm still here, yeah
Am I the one you were sent to save?
And it came upon me wave on wave
Yeah, it came upon me wave on wave
You're the reason I'm still here, yeah
Am I the one you were sent to save?
And it came upon me wave on wave
