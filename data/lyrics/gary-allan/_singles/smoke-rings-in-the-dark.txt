[Verse 1]
Well I won't make you tell me what I've come to understand
You're a certain kind of woman, I'm a different kind of man
I've tried to make you love me, you've tried to find a spark
Of the flame that burned and somehow turned to smoke rings in the dark

[Verse 2]
The loneliness within me takes a heavy toll
Because it burns as slow as whiskey through an empty aching soul
And the night is like a dagger, long and cold and sharp
As I sit here on the front steps blowing smoke rings in the dark

[Chorus]
I know I must be going
'Cause love's already gone
And all I'm taking with me are the pieces of my heart
And all I'll leave are smoke rings in the dark

[Verse 3]
The rain falls where it wants to, the wind blows where it will
Everything on earth goes somewhere, but I swear we're standing still
So I'm not going to wake you, I'll go easy on your heart
I'll just touch your face and drift away like smoke rings in the dark

[Chorus]
I know I must be going
'Cause love's already gone
And all I'm taking with me are the pieces of my heart
And all I'll leave are smoke rings in the dark
