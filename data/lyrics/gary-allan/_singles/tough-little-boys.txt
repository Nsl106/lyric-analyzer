[Verse 1]
Well, I never once
Backed down from a punch
Well, I'd take it square on the chin
Well I found out fast
A bully's just that
You've got to stand up to him
So I didn't cry when I got a black eye
As bad as it hurt, I just grinned

[Hook]
But when tough little boys grow up to be Dads
They turn into big babies again

[Chorus 1]
Scared me to death
When you took your first steps
And I'd fall every time you fell down
Your first day of school, I cried like a fool
And I followed your school bus to town

[Post-Chorus]
Well I didn't cry, when Old Yeller died
At least not in front of my friends

[Hook]
But when tough little boys grow up to be Dads
They turn into big babies again

[Verse 2]
Well I'm a grown man
And as strong as I am
Sometimes it's hard to believe
That one little girl, with little blonde curls
Can totally terrify me
If you were to ask
My wife would just laugh
She'd say I know all about men

[Hook]
How when tough little boys grow up to be Dads
They turn into big babies again

[Chorus 2]
Well I know one day, I'll give you away
And I'm gonna to stand there and smile
But when I get home, and I'm all alone
I'll sit in your room for awhile

[Post-Chorus]
Well I didn't cry, when Old Yeller died
At least not in front of my friends

[Hook]
But when tough little boys grow up to be Dads
They turn into big babies again

When tough little boys grow up to be Dads
They turn into big babies again
