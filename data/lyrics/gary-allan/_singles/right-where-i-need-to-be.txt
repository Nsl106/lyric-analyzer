[Verse 1]
There's a plane flying out of here tonight
Destination New Orleans
Boss man says my big promotion's on the line
He says that's right where I need to be
[Verse 2]
Lately I've been on the road more than I've been home
All this leaving her alone is killing me
And holding her right now has got me thinking more and more
This is right where I need to be

[Chorus]
Where when I hear her, I can see her, I can smell her sweet perfume
I can feel her skin against me when I sleep
Where I won't miss her, I can kiss her anytime that I want to
Yeah, that's right where I need to be
Yeah, that's right where I need to be

[Verse 3]
There's a plane flying out of here tonight
With an empty first class seat
Because I've finally got all my priorities in line
And I'm right where I need to be

[Chorus]
Where when I hear her, I can see her, I can smell her sweet perfume
I can feel her skin against me when I sleep
Where I won't miss her, I can kiss her anytime that I want to
Yeah, that's right where I need to be
Yeah, that's right where I need to be
