[Verse 1]
So you sailed away into a grey sky morning
Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
And nothing's quite the same now
I just say your name now

[Chorus]
But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't want me back
You're just the best I ever had

[Verse 2]
So you stole my world, now I'm just a phony
Remembering the girl leaves me down and lonley
Well send it in a letter
Make yourself feel better

[Chorus]
But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You dont want me back
You're just the best I ever had

[Verse 2]
And it might take some time to patch me up inside
But I can't take it so I, I run away and hide
And I might find in time that you were always right
You're always right

[Bridge]
So you sailed away into a grey sky morning
Now, I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
Was it what you wanted?
Could it be I'm haunted?

[Chorus]
But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You dont want me back
You're just the best I ever had

You're just the best I ever had
