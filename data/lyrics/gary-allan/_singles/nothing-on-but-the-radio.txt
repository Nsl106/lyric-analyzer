[Verse 1]
I sure do hope this is a long night
'Cause I have never felt one so right
Each look into your eyes, I'm falling
A little more and more

[Pre-Chorus]
Looks like we started us a fire
Wrapped up in flames of desire
With every touch, they're burning higher
Two shadows dancing on the wall

[Chorus]
With nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio

[Verse 2]
We'll fall asleep here in the moonlight
In tangled sheets, we'll be here all night
And when we wake up in the morning
We might stay like this all day

[Pre-Chorus]
Two people meant to be together
Two lovers dreaming of forever
And it just keeps on getting better
With every tender little kiss

[Chorus]
Nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio

[Bridge]
Two people meant to be together
Two lovers dreaming of forever
And it just keeps on getting better
With nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio
