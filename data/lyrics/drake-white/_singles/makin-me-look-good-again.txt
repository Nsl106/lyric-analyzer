[Verse 1]
Worn and haggard, weathered and torn
Drug through the keyhole of that back door
Blood shot red behind these shades
I look like hell, I've seen better days

[Chorus]
And then those loving arms, they pull me back in
And there you go, baby, yeah, oh, makin' me look good again

[Verse 2]
I'm rust on the barbed wire, I'm dust on the chrome
Oh, I'm the heart that bleeds in an old country song

[Chorus]
Then those loving arms, they pull me back in
Ooh, there you go, baby, yeah, oh, makin' me look good again

[Verse 3]
Leather and lace, denim and pearls
Whiskey and wine, they go just fine, like you and me, girl
When you smile at me and say, well, there ain't no better place
Than you'd rather be than right here lovin' me

[Bridge]
Yeah, oh
Standing in that kitchen, it's been a long day at work
And she slips her hands right under my shirt

[Chorus]
Oh, with those loving arms, she pulls me back in
And there you go, baby, yeah, oh, makin' me look good again
Oh, there you go, baby
Makin' me look good again
