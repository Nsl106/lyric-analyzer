[Verse 1]
Well, he saw it on TV and ordered that video
He learned every step at home and never told a soul
When I saw him out there the very first time, I knew
Well, if Bubba can dance, well, I can too

[Chorus]
Well, if Bubba can scoot, Bubba can slide
Bubba can two-step and Bubba can glide
I never thought he had the nerve, he never said a word
Well, everybody in the place stand back and give me some room
'Cause if Bubba can dance, I can too

[Verse 2]
Now I've been watchin' all night and I'm workin' my courage up
Hey, that dude's on the floor and he's doin' all the latest stuff
Well, if he's brave enough then I know what I've gotta do
Well, if Bubba can dance, I can too

[Chorus]
Well, if Bubba can scoot, Bubba can slide
Bubba can two-step and Bubba can glide
I never thought he had the nerve, he never said a word
Well, everybody in the place stand back and give me some room
'Cause if Bubba can dance, I can too

[Outro]
Well, if Bubba can dance, I can too
Well, if Bubba can dance, I can too
