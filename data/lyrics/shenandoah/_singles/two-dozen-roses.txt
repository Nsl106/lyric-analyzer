[Verse 1]
I brought flowers to your door last night
I done you wrong and I wanna make it right
You say I'm not welcome here
I know it oughta be perfectly clear
But I can't help but wonder what it might be like

[Chorus]
If I had two dozen roses
And an older bottle of wine
If I really coulda hung the moon
Would you change your mind
If I could cry a little harder
And get a little less sleep at night
If I had two dozen roses
Would it change your mind

[Verse 2]
Oh, I must have been a fool back then
To lose something that you can't have again
I've done all that I know to do
And second guessed my every move
I can't help but wonder how it might have been

[Chorus]
If I had two dozen roses
And an older bottle of wine
If I really coulda hung the moon
Would it change your mind
If I could cry a little harder
And get a little less sleep at night
If I had two dozen roses
Would it change your mind

[Outro]
If I could cry a little harder
And get a little less sleep at night
If I had two dozen roses
Would it change your mind
Oh baby, would you change your mind
Oh baby, would you change your mind
Oh baby, would you change your mind
Oh baby, could you change your mind
Oh baby, would you change your mind
