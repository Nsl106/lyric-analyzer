[Verse 1]
We got married one afternoon in May
Never did see the light of day on our honeymoon
We didn't have much when we started out
Your grandma's bed in a three room house, but we made do

[Refrain]
But oh, I got you
Oh, I got you

[Verse 2]
You could've had that boy you used to know
He's a millionaire from Ohio, your mama told me so
When the best I could do was the factory
You didn't get much when you got me, baby, that's true

[Refrain]
But oh, I got you
Oh, I got you

[Bridge]
Well, I got something that money can't buy
Cross my heart and I hope to die
Don't need nothing that I can't afford
I got you and I thank the Lord

[Verse 3]
Now if all that's left is the rocking chair
I'll be fine knowing you'll be there rocking too
Oh, long as I got you
Oh, long as I got you

[Refrain]
But oh, I got you
Oh, I got you
Oh, I got you
Oh, I got you
