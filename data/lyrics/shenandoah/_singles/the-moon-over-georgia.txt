[Verse 1]
He owns a big estate just south of Savannah
And a high rise hotel in downtown Atlanta
Add half the state of Georgia to his name
She'd be set for life in his colonial manor
He laid the world at her feet on a silver platter
But all I had to offer her was the moon

[Chorus]
And she took the moon over Georgia
She'd rather have a million stars in the sky than a gold mine
She took the moon over Georgia
When it came down to his world or mine
She took the moon over Georgia

[Verse 2]
A little country house in need of expansion
It's a far cry from his south Georgia mansion
But we've got our own paradise
Shadows dancin' 'til dawn with a full moon shinin'
And those occasional clouds all have a silver linin'
There really must be something about that old yellow light

[Chorus]
She took the moon over Georgia
She'd rather have a million stars in the sky than a gold mine
Yeah she took the moon over Georgia
When it came down to his world or mine
She took the moon over Georgia
She took the moon over Georgia
