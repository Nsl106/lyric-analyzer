[Verse 1]
Ridin' down the road in my pickup truck
You better be ready, 'cause I'm pickin' you up
With a full moon a-shinin' and a little bit of luck
We'll run out of gas and maybe get stuck

[Chorus]
We could get lost, baby, I don't care
I ain't worried as long as you're there
There ain't no place that I'd rather be
Next to you, sittin' next to me
There ain't no place that I'd rather be
Next to you, next to me

[Verse 2]
Barbecue chicken in aluminum foil
Just enough money for my gas and oil
Who needs your shrimp and your caviar?
I'd sooner have you just the way you are

[Chorus]
Rich people got their money to hold
Mansion on the hill and diamonds and gold
It can't compare as far as I can see
Next to you, sittin' next to me
There ain't no place that I'd rather be
Next to you, next to me

[Verse 3]
Radio playing our favorite song
I'll change the station if the news comes on
When the signal ain't coming in too strong
We'll make our own music, honey, all night long

[Verse 4]
If the good Lord's willin', when we're old and gray
The kids are grown up and moved away
We'll be rocking there side by side
With the barbecue chicken and the TV Guide

[Refrain]
Well, there ain't no place that I'd rather be
Next to you, sittin' next to me
No, there ain't no place that I'd rather be
Next to you, next to me
There ain't no place that I'd rather be
Next to you, next to me

[Outro]
Next to you, next to me
Next to you, next to me
Next to you, next to me
Next to you, next to me
