[Verse 1]
She used to sit there by the window
Worrying half to death, waiting for my car
Not knowing if or when I'd come home
And when I finally would
She'd be right there at the door
She used to cry and carry on
Those were the days, but now they're gone

[Chorus]
She doesn't cry anymore
She don't wait up at night
She don't put up a fight
Her heart doesn't ache like before
I went too far, I guess she's had enough
She's given up on love
She doesn't cry anymore

[Verse 2]
What was I thinking? I must've been crazy
'Cause when she needed me, I was never there
What I wouldn't do for one more chance now
Just one ray of hope, a sign that she still cares
No use trying to apologize
No use trying to dry her eyes

[Chorus]
She doesn't cry anymore
She don't wait up at night
She don't put up a fight
Her heart doesn't ache like before
I went too far, I guess she'd had enough
She's given up on love
She doesn't cry anymore

[Outro]
I guess she's had enough
She's given up on love
She doesn't cry anymore
