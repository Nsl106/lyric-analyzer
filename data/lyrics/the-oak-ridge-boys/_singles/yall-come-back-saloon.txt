She played tambourine with a silver jingle
And she must have known the words to at least a million tunes
But the one most requested by the man she knew a cowboy
Was the late-night benediction at the y'all come back saloon

In a voice soft and trembling
She'd sing her song to cowboy as a smokey halo circled 'round her raven hair
And all the fallen angels and pinball-playing rounders
Stopped the games that they'd been playing for the losers' evening prayer

Faded love and faded memories how they linger in her mind
Miles and years played the cowboy like an old melody out of tune and out of time

Every night in the shadows thinking back on Amarillo
He'd dream of better days and ask for faded love
Lifting high his glass in honor of the lady and her song
He paid his check then lonely walked the broken cowboy home

Faded love and faded memories how they linger in her mind
Miles and years played the cowboy like an old melody out of tune and out of time
Faded love and faded memories how they linger in her mind
Miles and years played the cowboy like an old melody out of tune and out of time
