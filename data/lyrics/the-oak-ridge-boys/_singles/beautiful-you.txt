[Verse 1]
Please don't cry
Oh my, you're so blue
But I'm here to help you, beautiful you
You need someone
To give you a love that's true
Well, I'm here to help you, beautiful you

[Verse 2]
Beautiful you
You'll need a man someday
Beautiful you
You know I'm here to stay
Days go by
Oh my, what will you do?
Take me to help you, beautiful you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Beautiful you
I'll never let you go
Beautiful you
Our love will always grow
Please don't cry
Oh my, what will you do?
Take me to help you, beautiful you

[Instrumental Outro]
