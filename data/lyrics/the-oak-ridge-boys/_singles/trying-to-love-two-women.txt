[Chorus]
Trying to love two women is like a ball and chain
Trying to love two women is like a ball and chain
Sometimes the pleasure ain't worth the strain
It's a long old grind, and it tires your mind

[Verse 1]
Trying to hold two women is tearing me apart
Trying to hold two women is tearing me apart
One's got my money, the other's got my heart
It's a long old grind, and it tires your mind

[Bridge]
When you try to please two women, you can't please yourself
When you try to please two women, you can't please yourself
At best it's only half good; a man can't stock two shelves
It's a long old grind, and it tires your mind

[Chorus]
[Chorus]
