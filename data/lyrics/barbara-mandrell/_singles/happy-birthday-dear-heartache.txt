It's just a year today
One year since he went away
So happy birthday, dear heartache
You're one year old today

There'll be the cake tonight
One candle I'm gonna light
So happy birthday, dear heartache
Old love still burns tonight

When he walked out, I felt my heart break
That's when you came to me, dear heartache
You made my heart your home
Now look how big you've grown

Looks like each guest is here
The blues, the memories, and the tears
So happy birthday, dear heartache
Same time, same place next year
So happy birthday, dear heartache
Same time, same place next year
