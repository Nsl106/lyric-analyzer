[Intro]
You know, sometimes in your life
You may find it hurts to be in love
Especially when you and the one you love
Already belong to somebody else
You're tied to her and I'm tied to him
And we don't wanna hurt either one of them
That's how it is

[Verse 1]
When you're married
But not to each other
You gotta go home in the middle of the night
Try and pretend everything's alright
But it ain't, no, it ain't
When you're married (When you're married)
But not to each other (To each other)
Make believe that you've been good
Give your love to the one you should
But you can't, no, you can't

[Chorus]
'Cause you're tied to her, I'm tied to him
We don't wanna hurt either one of them
So what can you do? What can you do?

[Verse 2]
When you're married
But not to each other
You gotta be careful everywhere you go
You're tryin' to avoid everyone you know
'Cause people talk, you know they talk
When you're married (When you're married)
But not to each other (To each other)
You gotta make up alibis
Hopin' they don't sound like lies
'Cause if you get caught and you might get caught

[Bridge]
Hurry up and love him, hurry up and please him
And when it gets right, you've got to leave him
You better leave him

[Chorus]
'Cause you're tied to her, I'm tied to him
We don't wanna hurt either one of them
That's how it is, that's how it is

[Outro]
When you're married
But not to each other
Hurry up and love him, hurry up and please him
And when it gets right, you've got to leave him
You better leave him
When you're married (When you're married)
But not
