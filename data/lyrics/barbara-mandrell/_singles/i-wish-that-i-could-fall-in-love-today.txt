I wish that I could fall in love today
But memories of you stand in the way
And I just can't make my heart find someone new
'Cause it's always much to busy lovin' you

Each night I pray I'll wake at dawn and find
Another in my heart and on my mind
Then I awake I hear my poor heart say
I wish that I could fall in love today
I wish that I could fall in love today
But if I did I know I wouldn't stay
'Cause you'd come between us like you always do
Somehow they never measure up to you

Oh I wish that I could fall in love today
