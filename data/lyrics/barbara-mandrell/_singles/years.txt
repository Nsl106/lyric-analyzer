[Verse 1]
Faded photographs
The feelings all come back
Even now sometimes
You feel so near
And I still see your face
Like it was yesterday
It's strange how the days turned into years

[Chorus]
Years of hanging on (Hanging on)
To dreams are already gone
Years of wishing you were here
After all this time (All this time)
You'd think I wouldn't cry
It's just that I still love you after all these years

[Verse 2]
Nighttime gently falls
Another day is gone
I turn around to find you're still not here
I leave the hall light on
In case you come back home
But I've been saying that for years

[Chorus]
Years of hanging on (Hanging on)
To dreams are already gone
Years of wishing you were here
After all this time (All this time)
You'd think I wouldn't cry
It's just that I still love you after all these years

[Outro]
After all these years
