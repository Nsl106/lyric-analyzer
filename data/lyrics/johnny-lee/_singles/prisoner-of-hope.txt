My friends say she's sophisticated and free
Never fall for an outlaw like me
Too high and refined
I'm just wastin' my time
Forget her

But I'm kind of caught in the web
The lady has gone to my head
I no longer cope
I'm a prisoner of hope since I met her

I'm a prisoner of hope
Just trying to win the smile in her eyes
The touch of her skin
She would discount me as one of her friends
Somehow I know where the friendship would end

With her in my arms
And her by my side
With her in my days
And her in my nights
Making up love out of pure fantasy
Prisoners of hope never want to be free

Yesterday I caught her in a glance
More than a coincidence
But she turned away as if to say "I'm above it"

She says that love is a trick of the night
And it's all done with mirrors and lights
But when I act like a fool
Like some kid back in school
She loves it

I'm a prisoner of hope
Just trying to win the smile in her eyes
The touch of her skin
She would discount me as one of her friends
Somehow I know where the friendship would end

With her in my arms
And her by my side
With her in my days
And her in my nights
Making up love out of pure fantasy
Prisoners of hope never want to be free
