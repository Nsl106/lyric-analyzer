Went partying the other night
Started drinking and got real tight
We was playing with all our friends
Felt so good we had to play it again

Hey bartender, hey man
(Hey bartender)
Here
(Hey bartender)
Draw a one, draw a two
Draw a three more glasses of beer

Now she was sitting down on the end
I said, "Baby can we be friends
You look as sweet as can be
Come on down and drink with me"

Hey bartender, hey man
(Hey bartender)
Hey bartender
(Hey bartender)
Draw a one, draw a two
Draw a three more glasses of beer

Well we was having so much fun
I didn't know it was half past one
Turned around gonna have one more
I looked at the clock and it was half past four

Hey bartender, hey man
(Hey bartender)
Hey bartender
(Hey bartender)
Draw a one, draw a two
Draw a three more glasses of beer

Well the jukebox playing and everything
Everybody was beginning to sing
That's when I heard somebody call
Last call for alcohol

Hey bartender, hey man
(Hey bartender)
Hey bartender
(Hey bartender)
Hey bartender, lookie here
(Hey bartender)
Hey bartender
(Hey bartender)
Draw a one, draw a two
Draw a three more glasses of beer
