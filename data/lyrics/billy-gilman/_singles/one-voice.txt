[Verse 1]
Some kids have and some kids don't
And some of us are wondering why
Mom won't watch the news at night
There's too much stuff that's making her cry

[Chorus]
We need some help
Down here on Earth
A thousand prayers, a million words
But one voice was heard

[Verse 2]
A house, a yard, a neighborhood
Where you can ride your new bike to school
A kind of world where Mom and Dad
Still believe in the golden rule

[Chorus]
Life's not that simple
Down here on Earth
A thousand prayers, a million words
But one voice was heard

[Bridge]
One voice, one simple word
Hearts know what to say
One dream can change the world
Keep believing 'til you find your way

[Verse 3]
Yesterday, while walking home
I saw some kid on Newberry Road
He pulled a pistol from his bag
And tossed it in the river below

[Chorus]
Thanks for the help
Down here on Earth
A thousand prayers, a million words
But one voice was heard
One voice was heard
One voice was heard
