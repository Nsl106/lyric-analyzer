Thank you for the laughter, thank you for your smile
I'm thankin' you for making me feel good for a while
And if there's any question just how good you are
When it comes to lovin', baby, you're a superstar

I had a lovely time, what can I say
I had a lovely time, so glad that I could stay
Oh, the music and the laughter and lovin' sure is fine
I just gotta tell you, I had a lovely time

Good friends can't be lovers, lovers can't be friends
I just love the way you're sayin', please come back again

I had a lovely time, what can I say
I had a lovely time, what can I say
