When we're holding each other in the dark hours of the night
There are those who say it's wrong but it's right
'Cause the way that we feel how much sin can it be
Lord, it don't feel like sinnin' to me

No, it don't feel like sinnin' to me
Feels like love feels like love
No, it don't feel like sinnin' to me
Feels like love feels like love

So let them talk about us let them gossip away
Jealous tongues will find something evil to say
But if they could remember first love they call
That it don't feel like sinnin' at all

No, it don't feel like sinnin' to me
No, it don't feel like sinnin' to me
