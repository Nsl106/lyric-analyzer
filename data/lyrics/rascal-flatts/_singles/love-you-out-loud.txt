[Verse 1]
I have always been a little shy
I've always been the quiet type 'till now
I-I-I, I never let my feelings show
I never let anybody know just how
Much I was so deep in love
But now that you're in my arms

[Chorus]
I'm gonna stand on a rooftop
Climb up a mountaintop
Baby, scream and shout
I wanna sing it on the radio
Show it on a video
Baby, leave no doubt
I want the whole world to know (World to know)
Just what I'm all about
I love to love you out loud

[Verse 2]
You keep bringing out the free in me
What you do to my heart just makes me melt
And I-I-I, I don't think I can resist
But I've never been one to kiss and tell
Our love this true, can't be subdued
So I'm gonna let out a yell

[Chorus]
I'm gonna stand on a rooftop
Climb up a mountaintop
Baby, scream and shout
I wanna sing it on the radio
Show it on a video
Baby, leave no doubt
I want the whole world to know (World to know)
Just what I'm all about
I love to love you out loud

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Baby, I want the whole world to see
(I want the whole world to see)
Just how good your love looks on me

[Chorus]
I'm gonna stand on a rooftop
Climb up a mountaintop
Baby, scream and shout
I wanna sing it on the radio
Show it on a video
Baby, leave no doubt
I want the whole world to know (World to know)
Just what I'm all about
I love to love you
Baby, I love to love you out loud

[Outro]
I love to love you out loud
