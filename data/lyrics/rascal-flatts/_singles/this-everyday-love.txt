[Intro]
Can't get enough of this everyday love
Can't get enough of this everyday love

[Verse 1]
Each morning the sun shines through my window
Lands on the face of a dream come true
I shuffle to the kitchen for my coffee
And catch up on the front page morning news
Then she walks up behind me
And throws her arms around my neck
Just another normal thing
I've come to expect

[Chorus]
It's ordinary, plain and simple
Typical, this everyday love
Same ol', same ol', keepin' it new (Same ol')
Everyday love
Emotional, so familiar
Nothing about it too peculiar
Oh, but I can't get enough
Of this everyday love, yeah

[Verse 2]
Every afternoon I make a phone call
Listen to the voice that warms my heart
I drag myself through a few more hours
Then head on home to try and beat the dark
Her smile will be right there
When I step through that door
And it will be that way tomorrow
Just like every day before

[Chorus]
It's ordinary, plain and simple
Typical, this everyday love
Same ol', same ol', keepin' it new (Same ol')
Everyday love
Emotional, so familiar
Nothing about it too peculiar
Oh, but I can't get enough
Of this everyday love

[Bridge]
Wouldn't change one single thing about it, no
It's run-of-the-mill
Still, I can't live without it

[Chorus]
It's ordinary, plain and simple
Typical, this everyday love
Same ol', same ol', keepin' it new
This everyday love
Emotional, so familiar
Nothing about it too peculiar
Oh, but I can't get enough (Can't get enough)
Of this everyday love, yeah
Of this everyday love

[Outro]
Can't get enough of this everyday love
Can't get enough of this everyday love
Can't get enough of this everyday love
Can't get enough
