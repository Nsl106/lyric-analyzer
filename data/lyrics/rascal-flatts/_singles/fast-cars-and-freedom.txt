[Intro]
Mhm
Ooh, yeah
Mhm

[Verse 1]
Starin' at you takin' off your makeup
Wonderin' why you even put it on
I know you think you do, but baby, you don't need it
Wish that you could see what I see when it's gone

[Chorus]
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
Wait, baby, don't move, right there it is
A T-shirt hangin' off a Dogwood Branch
That river was cold, but we gave love a chance
Yeah, yeah, to me
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank, first time feelin'
Oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Yeah, smile and shake your head as if you don't believe me
I'll just sit right here and let you take me back
I'm on that gravel road, look at me
On my way to pick you up
You're standing on the front porch looking just like that
Remember that

[Chorus]
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
Wait, baby, don't move, right there it is
A T-shirt hangin' off a Dogwood Branch
That river was cold, but we gave love a chance
Yeah, yeah, to me
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank, first time feelin'

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank, first time feelin'

[Outro]
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova (No, no, no)
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
(You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom)
A T-shirt hangin' off a Dogwood Branch (That river bank)
That river was cold, but we gave love a chance
