[Verse 1]
When you light those candles
Up there on that mantle, settin' the mood
Well, I just lie there starin'
Silently preparin' to love on you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Well, I can feel the heat
From across the room
Ain't it wild what a little flame can make you wanna do?

[Chorus]
I melt, every time you look at me that way
It never fails
Anytime, any place
This burn in me is the coolest thing I've ever felt
I melt

[Verse 2]
Don't know how you do it
I love the way I lose it, every time
What's even better is knowin' that forever, you're all mine

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The closer you get, the more my body aches
One little stare from you is all it takes

[Chorus]
I melt, every time you look at me that way
It never fails
Anytime, any place
This burn in me is the coolest thing I've ever felt
I melt

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I melt (I melt), every time you look at me that way
It never fails (Fails)
Anytime, any place
This burn in me is the coolest thing I've ever felt
I melt (I melt)
(I just melt)

[Outro]
Every time you look at me that way (I just melt)
I melt (I just melt)
I melt
