[Verse 1]
Sprayed my name on a water tower
Carved it in an old cottonwood tree
Signed a bunch of high school yearbooks
So they wouldn't forget about me
It wasn't 'til I saw my daddy's name in stone I knew
It ain't a question of if they will
It's how they remember you

[Chorus]
Did you stand or did you fall?
Build a bridge or build a wall
Hide your love or give it all
What did you do? What did you do?
Did you make 'em laugh or make 'em cry?
Did you quit or did you try?
Live your dreams or let 'em die?
What did you choose? What did you choose?
When it all comes down
It ain't if, it's how they remember you

[Verse 2]
When you're down to your last dollar
Will you give or will you take?
When the stiff wind blows the hardest
Will you bend or will you break? (Will you break?)
You're gonna leave a legacy, no matter what you do
It ain't a question of if they will
It's how they remember you

[Chorus]
Did you stand or did you fall?
Build a bridge or build a wall
Hide your love or give it all
What did you do? What did you do?
Did you make 'em laugh or make 'em cry?
Did you quit or did you try?
Live your dreams or let 'em die
What did you choose? What did you choose?
When it all comes down
It ain't if, it's how they remember you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Did you make 'em laugh or make 'em cry?
Did you quit or did you try?
Live your dreams or let 'em die
What did you choose? (What did you choose?)
Oh, when it all comes down
It ain't if, it's how they remember you

[Outro]
How they, how they remember you
How they, how they remember you
How they, how they remember you (How they remember)
How they, how they remember you
How they, how they remember you
How they, how they remember you
How they, how they remember you (How they remember)
How they, how they remember you (How they remember you)
