[Verse 1: Rascal Flatts]
Front of the line, straight past the bouncer
Looking so fine that the band announced ya
Gotcha tight jeans on and your hair done right
All your girlfriends say we throwing down tonight
Let me guess, somebody done you wrong
And you're looking for a way to get your feel good on
Get some pictures on the Instagram and show him what he's missing
Straight no chaser, girl on a mission

[Chorus: Rascal Flatts]
Baby I could be your payback
Hey, gonna help you get your sway back
Take ya to the dance floor, I'ma lean ya way back
Yeah, I'ma lean ya way back
Gonna have a real good time
Don't worry 'bout your tab, girl, put it on mine
We can show him what he can't have
If you wanna play that game
Yeah, baby I can be your payback

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2: Rascal Flatts]
I bet he's sitting at home all alone in the dark
Probably texting like mad, wants to know where you are
Cause he didn't even know what he had 'til he lost it
Should have known running around was gonna cost him
No way that girl is as pretty as you
I never even seen her but I know that it's true
If he was even half a man he wouldn't have blown it
Thinking about it that way feels good don't it

[Chorus: Rascal Flatts]
Baby I could be your payback
Hey, gonna help you get your sway back
Take ya to the dance floor, I'ma lean ya way back
Yeah, I'ma lean ya way back
Gonna have a real good time
Don't worry 'bout your tab, girl, put it on mine
We can show him what he can't have
If you wanna play that game
Yeah, baby I can be your payback

[Outro: Rascal Flatts]
Let me be your payback
Gonna help ya get your sway back
He's gonna hate that
I can be your p-p-p-p-payback
I can be your p-p-p-p-payback
I can be your p-p-p-p-payback
I can be your p-p-p-p-payback

Yeah
