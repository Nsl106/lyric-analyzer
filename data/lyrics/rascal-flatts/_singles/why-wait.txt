[Verse 1]
What do you say girl, we do something crazy
Quit putting it off, you know what I'm saying
Ain't like it ain't gonna happen, forever's a given
It's already written
Who we kidding? Baby, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
The stars can't line up any straighter
Let's do it now and think about it later

[Chorus]
Why wait another minute
For something we should'a done yesterday?
I know a little church
With a preacher who could hook us up right away
Love don't need a reason
Baby, I don't see how I could love you anymore than I do today
So why wait

[Verse 2]
Now I love your mama, let's save her some trouble
And your daddy won't mind if we save him a bundle
Girl, it just so happens, that ring that you wanted
Well guess what, I bought it
It's in my pocket baby, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's get it done, let's get it on your left hand
This is me, girl, popping the question

[Chorus]
Why wait another minute
For something we should'a done yesterday?
I know a little church
With a preacher who could hook us up right away
Love don't need a reason
Baby I don't see how I could love you anymore than I do today
So why wait

[Bridge]
Let's do something crazy
'Cause crazy's what you make me

[Chorus]
Why wait another minute
Wait another minute, c'mon
I know a little church
With a preacher who could hook us up right away
Love don't need a reason
Baby I don't see how I could love you anymore than I do today
So why wait

[Outro]
What do you say girl we do something crazy
