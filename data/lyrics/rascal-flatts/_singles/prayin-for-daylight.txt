[Intro]
I don't wanna spend another lonely night
Ooh

[Verse 1]
I've got the lights turned up
The door is locked
The bedroom TV's on
Doin' the only thing
That gets me through the night
Since you've been gone

[Chorus]
Prayin' for daylight, waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't goin' wrong
Baby, come back to me, I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight (Prayin' for daylight)

[Verse 2]
I made a bad miscalculation
Bettin' you would never leave
'Cause if you're gettin' on with your new life
Then where does that leave me?

[Chorus]
Prayin' for daylight, waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't goin' wrong
Baby, come back to me, I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight (Prayin' for daylight)
Prayin' for daylight (Prayin' for daylight)
Prayin' for daylight

[Bridge]
Hoping that I didn't wait too long (I didn't wait too long)
That this is just the dark before the dawn

[Verse 3]
Deep in my heart
I know that you love me as much as I love you
(You know I love you, girl)
And that you must be lyin' somewhere
Looking up to heaven too

[Chorus]
Prayin' for daylight, waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't goin' wrong
Baby, come back to me, I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
(Make me spend another lonely night)
Prayin' for daylight, waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't goin' wrong
Baby, come back to me, I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
(Don't make me spend another lonely night)
Prayin' for daylight (Prayin' for daylight)
Prayin' for daylight

[Outro]
I don't wanna spend another lonely night
I don't wanna spend another lonely night (Prayin' for daylight)
Prayin' for daylight
I don't wanna spend another lonely night
Ooh
Prayin' for daylight
