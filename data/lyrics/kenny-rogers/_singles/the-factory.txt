[Verse 1]
I can't say that he loved his work
But he fed a family of nine
Papa never heard of a union
He logged his scale in time
But he was a lucky man
At least he had a job
Down at the factory

[Verse 2]
40 years cut across his back
Fightin' it tooth and nail
Work was hard enough to make a man
Forget his fear of Hell
He was a thankful man
He had a job
Down at the factory

[Chorus]
Sometimes through the walls at night
I'd hear him on his knees
Prayin', "Lord, please help me through another day
Give me strength
And bless this house
This family of mine
And thank you, Lord
For my job
Down at the factory"

[Verse 3]
It's hard for a man to build a life
On a miller's pay
But like father just like son
At least I could pay my way
I'm a lucky man
I've got a job
Down at the factory

[Verse 4]
As I put my kids to bed
Wonder what's in store
Ask the Lord for a better way
'Cause they deserve much more
Than to raise their own
With just a job
Down at the factory

[Chorus]
Sometimes when it's late at night
I get down on my knees
Prayin, "Lord, please help me through another day
And give me strength
And bless this house
This family of mine
And, thank you, Lord
For my job
Down at the factory"
We got more than some
At least I got a job
Down at the factory
