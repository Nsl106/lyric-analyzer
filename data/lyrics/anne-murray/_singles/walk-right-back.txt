I want you to tell me why you walked out on me
I'm so lonesome every day
I want you to know that since you walked out on me
Nothing seems to be the same old way

Think about the love that burns within my heart for you
The good times we had before you went away on me
Walk right back to me this minute
Bring your love to me don't spin (send) it
I'm so lonesome every day
