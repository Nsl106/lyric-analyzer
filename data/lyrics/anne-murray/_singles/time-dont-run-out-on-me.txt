[Verse 1]
Time, don't run out on me
Gotta make you love me the way you used to do
Gotta get back the feeling and put wind in my sails
And chart a course that gets me back to you, back to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, the lonely days, the lonely nights lookin' back in time

[Chorus]
Time, don't run out on me
I've gotta get back to where we used to be (Where we used to be)
Time, don't run out on me, don't run out on me

[Verse 2]
There's one more thing I gotta do before I pack it in
Gotta make the right moves
Say the right thing to change your mind
And find a way to get you back again, back again

[Pre-Chorus]
All the wasted time, the lonely nights lookin' back in time

[Chorus]
Time, don't run out on me
I've gotta get back to where we used to be (Where we used to be)
Time, don't run out on me

[Bridge]
Once I could catch your eye across the room
And know just what you were thinkin'
And when I held you in my arms, we'd dream as one
But those days are gone, somethin' went wrong
And when I wake up to the mornin' sun I find myself sayin'

[Chorus]
Time, don't run out on me
Don't run out on me
Don't run out on me
Time, don't run out on me
Time, don't run out on me
I've gotta get back to where we used to be (Where we used to be)
Time, don't run out on me

[Outro]
(Time, don't run out on me)
(Time, don't run out on me)
(Time, don't run out on me)
(Time, don't run out on me)
(Time, don't run out on me)
(Time, don't run out on me)
(Time, don't run out on me)
(Time, don't run out on me)
(Time, don't run...)
