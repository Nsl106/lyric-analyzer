[Chorus]
We'll be shadows in the moonlight
Darlin', I'll meet you at midnight
Hand and hand we'll go, dancin' through the Milky Way
And we'll find a little hideaway
Where we can love the whole night away (Ooh)
We'll be shadows in the moonlight right up 'til the light of day

[Verse]
Ooh, the night is young
Baby, so are we
Glad, I'm gonna make you glad you came
Ooh, you won't need a thing
Just bring your love for me
And darlin', I will do the same

[Chorus]
We'll be shadows in the moonlight (Shadows in the moonlight)
Darlin', I'll meet you at midnight (Ooh)
Hand and hand we'll go, dancin' through the Milky Way

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Ooh, you won't need a thing
Just bring your love for me
You'll be glad you came
Just wait and see (Wait and see)

[Chorus]
We'll be shadows in the moonlight (Shadows in the moonlight)
Darlin', I'll meet you at midnight (Ooh)
Hand and hand we'll go, dancin' through the Milky Way
And we'll find a little hideaway (Find a little hideaway)
Where we can love the whole night away (Ooh)
We'll be shadows in the moonlight right up 'til the light of day
