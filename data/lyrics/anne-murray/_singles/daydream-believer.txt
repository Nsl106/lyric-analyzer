[Verse 1]
Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings
Of the bluebird as she sings
The six o'clock alarm would never ring
But it rings and we rise
Wipe the sleep out of our eyes
The shaving razor's cold and it stings

[Chorus]
Cheer up, sleepy Jean, oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen?

[Verse 2]
I once thought of you
As a white knight on a steed
Now you know how happy we can be
Oh, when our good times started then
With a dollar one to spend
But how much, baby, do we really need?

[Chorus]
Cheer up, sleepy Jean, oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen?

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Cheer up, sleepy Jean, oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen?
Cheer up, sleepy Jean, oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen?
