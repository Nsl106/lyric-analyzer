[Verse]
The nights have been so lonely since you went away
I could not get to sleep, try as I may
But now you're back and you're here to stay

[Refrain]
Still it looks like another sleepless night
Oh, but darling, that's alright
Just as long as you are holding me tight

[Post-Refrain]
Making love 'til the early morning light
Only whets our appetite
This will be another sleepless night

[Chorus]
Hold me while the moon shines
In through the window, let your love flow
Hold me, we can orchestrate
Love's scenario with the radio

[Refrain]
And it looks like another sleepless night
Oh, but darling, that's alright
Just as long as you are holding me tight

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Hold me while the moon shines
In through the window, let your love flow
Hold me, we can orchestrate
Love's scenario with the radio

[Refrain]
And it looks like another sleepless night
Oh, but darling, that's alright
Just as long as you are holding me tight

[Post-Refrain]
Making love 'til the early morning light
Only whets our appetite
This will be another sleepless night
