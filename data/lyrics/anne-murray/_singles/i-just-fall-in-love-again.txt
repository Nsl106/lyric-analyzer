[Verse 1]
Dreaming, I must be dreaming
Or am I really lying here with you?
Baby, you take me in your arms
And though I'm wide awake, I know my dream is coming true

[Chorus]
And, oh, I just fall in love again
Just one touch and then it happens every time
There I go, I just fall in love again and when I do
I can't help myself, I fall in love with you

[Verse 2]
Magic, it must be magic
The way I hold you and the night just seems to fly
Easy for you to take me to a star
Heaven is that moment when I look into your eyes

[Chorus]
And, oh, I just fall in love again
Just one touch and then it happens every time
There I go, I just fall in love again and when I do
I can't help myself, I fall in love with you
I can't help myself, I fall in love with you
