Honey, you feel good all over
Each part is so easy to touch
Oh, you feel good all over
And that's why I need you so much

When you're here by my side
With your arms open wide
Heaven is happening to me
I don't know where to start
Lord, I love every part
And I want everything that I see

Honey, you feel good all over
Each part is so easy to touch
Oh, you feel good all over
And that's why I need you so much

When you're holding my hand
I'm one hell of a man
When you kiss me, you set me on fire
You're easy to hold
From your head to your toes
And you fill me up with desire
