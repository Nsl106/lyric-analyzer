[Verse 1]
She was going to pieces when he walked in the door
She just had to see him, she can't wait no more
Tonight he'll be with her, no matter the cost
As the band plays "The Last Cheater's Waltz"

[Verse 2]
He tells her he loves her, the music plays on
He tells her he needs her, someone's at home
The ball game's all over and she knows she's lost
As the band plays "The Last Cheater's Waltz"

[Verse 3]
And ooh ooh ooh don't they sound lonely
And ooh ooh ooh don't they play sad
And ooh ooh ooh three quarter lonely
Watch how he holds her
As they dance to "The Last Cheater's Waltz"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
And ooh ooh ooh don't they sound lonely
And ooh ooh ooh don't they play sad
And ooh ooh ooh three quarter lonely
Watch how he holds her
As they dance to "The Last Cheater's Waltz"
