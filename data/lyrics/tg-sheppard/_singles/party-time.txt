Ooh, ooh it's party time
It's time to get you off my mind
Forget the life I left behind
And all those dreams that won't come true

Ooh, ooh its party time
It's time for laugh and pass the wine
It's early and I'm feelin' fine, I'll soon be over you

Darlin' ever since the day
Yes it's time to go our separate ways
I've been searchin' for a way to be
For doing you so wrong

Now it's time to call the heart
You know it wasn't all my fault
You cheated too but you were never caught
Your friends lied all along

Ooh, ooh it's party time
It's time to get you off my mind
It's early and I'm feeling fine
I'll soon be over you

It shouldn't take us very long
Another sip or two and you'll be gone
Another chorus of she done you wrong
And I'll be over you

Ooh, ooh it's party time
It's time to get you off my mind
It's early and I'm feeling fine
I'll soon be over you

Ooh, ooh it's party time
It's time to get you off my mind
Forget the life I left behind
And all those dreams that won't come true

Ooh, ooh its party time
It's time for laugh and pass the wine
It's early and I'm feelin' fine, I'll soon be over you
