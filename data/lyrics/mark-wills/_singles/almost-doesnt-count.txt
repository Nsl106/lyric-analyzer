[Verse 1]
Almost made you love me
Almost made you cry
Almost made you happy, baby
Didn't I? Didn't I?
You almost had me thinkin'
You were turned around
But everybody knows
Almost doesn't count

[Verse 2]
Almost heard you saying
You were finally free
What was always missing for you, babe
You'd found it in me
But you can't get to Heaven
Half off the ground
Everybody knows
Almost doesn't count

[Chorus]
I can't keep lovin' you
One foot outside the door
I hear a funny hesitation
Of a heart that's never really sure
Can't keep on tryin'
If you're looking for more
Than all I could give you
Than what you came here for

[Verse 3]
Gonna find me somebody
Not afraid to let go
Want a no doubt be there kind of girl
You came real close
But every time you built me up
You only let me down
And everybody knows
Almost doesn't count

[Chorus]
I can't keep lovin' you
One foot outside the door
I hear a funny hesitation
Of a heart that's never really sure
Can't keep on tryin'
If you're looking for more
Than all I could give you
Than what you came here for

[Verse 4]
Maybe you'll be sorry
Maybe you'll be cold
Maybe you'll come running back, babe
From the cruel, cruel world
You almost convinced me
You're gonna stick around
But everybody knows
Almost doesn't count
So maybe I'll be here
Maybe I'll see you 'round
That's the way it goes
Almost doesn't count
