[Verse 1]
I've been looking at you, looking at me
Bet you're thinking that what you get is what you see
But underneath this cool exterior a raging river flows
So before you get any nearer, I better let you know

[Chorus]
I'm an emotional girl, I can't help myself
Sometimes I laugh, sometimes I cry
Sometimes I do both and I don't know why
I got a passionate heart and that's just the way things are
You and me could give it a whirl
But I'm warning you, boy, I'm an emotional girl

[Verse 2]
I like music that's loud and lights down low
I like driving my car too fast and dancing slow
Some folks may say I'm too extreme 'cause I can't stop once I start
But I never could do anything with half my heart

[Chorus]
I'm an emotional girl, I can't help myself
Sometimes I laugh, sometimes I cry
Sometimes I do both and I don't know why
I got a passionate heart and that's just the way things are
You and me could give it a whirl
But I'm warning you, boy, I'm an emotional girl

[Chorus]
I'm an emotional girl, I can't help myself
Sometimes I laugh, sometimes I cry
Sometimes I do both and I don't know why
I got a passionate heart and that's just the way things are
You and me could give it a whirl
But I'm warning you, boy, I'm an emotional girl

[Outro]
Yeah, you and me could give it a whirl
But I'm warning you, boy, I'm an emotional girl
