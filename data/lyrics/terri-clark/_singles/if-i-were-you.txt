[Verse 1]
You were standing at my front door
When I came home tonight
And I could tell by the look you gave me
You were needing my advice
You say you want more out of life than he can give you
As a tear rolls down your face
But girl, I've seen the way he looks at you
And I know someone who'd gladly take your place

[Chorus]
If I were you
I'd run back home tonight
Tell him everything's alright
Yeah, I know what I'd do
If I were you
I'd never let him go
I'd have someone to hold
My whole life through
If I were you

[Verse 2]
You shouldn't think you're missing out on something
Because you wear a wedding band
'Cause I can't seem to find somebody
Who wants more than just a one night stand
You know this single life I'm living
Ain't all it's cracked up to be
So you've come to the wrong place
If what you want is sympathy

[Chorus]
If I were you
I'd run back home tonight
Tell him everything's alright
Yeah, I know what I'd do
If I were you
I'd never let him go
I'd have someone to hold
My whole life through

[Chorus]
If I were you
I'd run back home tonight
Tell him everything's alright
Yeah, I know what I'd do
If I were you
I'd never let him go
I'd have someone to hold
My whole life though
If I were you
