[Verse 1]
First it's baseball, arcades in the mall
Skipping out of study hall to hang with the guys
Then it's fast cars, rock and roll guitars
Lighting up behind the barn and not knowing why

[Chorus]
But his life is about to change
He's never gonna be the same
And he'll be living in a different world
When boy meets girl

[Verse 2]
One smile, one look, he's nearly on the hook
Got it bad and feeling good all over inside
He ain't got a clue what he's going through
But he's going to, just give him time

[Chorus]
'Cause his life is about to change
He's never gonna be the same
He'll be living in a different world
When boy meets girl

[Verse 3]
He never polished his boots before
Never thought about what he wore
Never knew he could feel like that
Now there ain't no way he can ever go back

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, his life is about to change
He ain't never gonna be the same
And he'll be living in a different world
When boy meets girl

[Chorus]
His life is about to change
He's never gonna be the same
He'll be living in a different world
When boy meets girl

When boy meets girl, when boy meets girl
