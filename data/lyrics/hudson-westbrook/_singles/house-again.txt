[Verse 1]
Well this kitchen used to be a dance hall
Music on and the lights off
Just you and I used to be
Perfume on your pillow
New day through the window
Bringing out the blue in your eyes
Used to be four boots by the front door
But two ain't there anymore

[Chorus]
Now it's just 4 empty walls
Where I lay my head and get no rest at all
The porch swing don't swing
The doorbell don't ring
And now it's just wood on concrete
And numbers on a mailbox on used to be street
I guess you or I should have left when you did
The house you made a home is
Now just a house again

[Verse 2]
These days all I hear is an echo
Of you saying baby don't go
And your goodbye
If you came back you'd be surprised
You wouldn't even recognize this place without you
What the hell did you do

[Chorus]
Cuz now it's just 4 empty walls
Where I lay my head and get no rest at all
The porch swing don't swing
The doorbell don't ring
And now it's just wood on concrete
And numbers on a mailbox on a used to be street
I guess you or I should have left when you did
The house you made a home is
Now just a house again

[Bridge]
A kitchen that used to be a dance hall
With music on and the lights off

[Chorus]
But now it's just 4 empty walls
Where I lay my head and get no rest at all
The porch swing don't swing
The doorbell don't ring
And now it's just wood on concrete
And numbers on a mailbox on a used to be street
I guess you or I should have left when you did
The house you made a home is
Now just a house again
