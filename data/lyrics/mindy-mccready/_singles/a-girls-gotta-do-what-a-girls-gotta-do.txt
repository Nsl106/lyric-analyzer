[Verse 1]
The first thing I did when you said goodbye
Was sit myself down and have a real good cry
The next thing I did was put my red dress on
And go downtown dancing till the break of dawn

[Chorus]
A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do
And now I gotta get to getting over you
Too bad I gotta do it with someone new
But a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do

[Verse 2]
Fancy meeting you at our stomping ground
Sorry, if you caught me painting the town
Guess I shoulda stayed home with your memory
Baby, don't take it personally

[Chorus]
A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do
And now I gotta get to getting over you
Too bad I gotta do it with someone new
But a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do

[Bridge]
Give me a call some time real soon
And remind me to remember
To forget about you, oh yeah!

[Chorus]
A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do
And now I gotta get to getting over you
Too bad I gotta do it with someone new
But a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do

[Outro]
A girl's gotta do it, yeah, a girl's gotta do it
Too bad I gotta do it with someone new
Too bad I gotta do it with someone new
But a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do
