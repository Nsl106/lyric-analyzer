[Chorus]
This thing called love, I just can't handle it
This thing called love, I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love

[Verse 1]
This thing (this thing), called love (called love)
It cries (like a baby) in a cradle at night
It swings, it jives
It shakes all over like a jellyfish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

[Verse 2]
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock and roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

[Verse 3]
I gotta be cool, relax
Get hip and get on my tracks
Take a backseat, hitchhike
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

[Chorus]
This thing called love, I just can't handle it
This thing called love, I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love...
