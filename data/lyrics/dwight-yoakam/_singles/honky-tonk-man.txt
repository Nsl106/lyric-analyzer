[Chorus]
Well I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone telephone
Singing "Hey hey mama, can your daddy come home?"

[Verse 1]
Well now I'm living wild and dangerously
But I've got plenty of company
When the moon comes up and the sun goes down
Well I can't wait to see the lights of town

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
And when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone telephone
Singing "Hey hey mama, can your daddy come home?"

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Chorus]
Well I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
And when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone telephone
Singing "Hey hey mama, can your daddy come home?"

[Verse 2]
Hey now, a pretty little girl and a jug of wine
Well that's what it takes to make a honky tonk time
With the juke box moaning those honky tonk sounds
Well I can't wait to lay my money down

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone
Singing "Hey hey mama, can your daddy come home?"

[Chorus]
I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone
Singing "Hey hey mama, can your daddy come home?"
