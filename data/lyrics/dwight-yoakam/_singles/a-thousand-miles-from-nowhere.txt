[Chorus]
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be

[Verse 1]
I got heartaches in my pocket
I got echoes in my head
And all that I keep hearing
Are the cruel, cruel things that you said

[Chorus]
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be

[Bridge]
Oh, I...
Oh, I...
Oh, I...
Oh, I...
Oh, I...
Oh, I...

[Verse 2]
I've got bruises on my memory
I've got tearstains on my hands
And in the mirror, there's a vision
Of what used to be a man

[Chorus]
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be

[Outro]
Oh, I...
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
