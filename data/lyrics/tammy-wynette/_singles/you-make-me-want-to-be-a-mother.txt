There's a world full of men
And I could take 'em or-or lea-eave 'em
'Cause when one would let me down
There'd be ten more standin' 'round to take his place
And I remember back then
How I loved to just decei-eive 'em
Playin' with 'em like a toy
Then leave 'em like a little boy
With teardrops o-on hi-is face

Love was just a game
And I knew just how to play-ay it
And I'll never understand
You were just another ma-an to me
Ahh, but you've got close
To what I cherish mo-ost
Mmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

You make me want to be a mo-other
And walk around with pride
With your char-armin' side
You make me want to be a mo-other
Ahh, who'd have thought that I would
Ahh, but it feels so good
'Cause you've got close
To what I cherish most

Mmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
