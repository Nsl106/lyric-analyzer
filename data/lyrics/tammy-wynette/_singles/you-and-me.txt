Well we found a life together and it's a gonna last forever
Nothing can hurt me now cause you are mine
We put away all of our sadness we're walking every day with gladness
You and me together all the time
Well she wants to love me a little bit better it's okay I'm gonna let her
When he holds me I can feel he's hard giving love's true and real
Oh now we got a little bitty baby we're happy and we don't mean maybe
You and me together all the time
[ steel ]
Well we'll build a little house in the country and we'll go to church every Sunday
We got each other and we don't need a thing
We start every day with a sweet kiss and that's one thing we wouldn't miss
You and me together making life sweet
Well she wants to love me...
You and me together all the time
