Reach - out - your - hand
And touch somebody
Together build a dream
To call your own
Reach out your-our arms
And hold somebody
You've got too much love to give
To be alone

The world has never-er been so cold and lo-onely
The sky has never-er been a dee-eeper blue
Just like you, there's someo-one just as lo-onely
And you know God made 'em special just for you

Reach out your-our hand
And touch somebody
Together build a dream
To call your own
Reach out your-our arms
And hold somebody
You've got too much love to give
To be alone

Reach out your hand
