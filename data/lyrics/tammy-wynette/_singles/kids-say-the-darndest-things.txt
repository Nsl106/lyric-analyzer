[Chorus]
Kids say the darndest things
Have you ever listened close to the games they play
Or the little songs they sing?

[Verse 1]
Last night, dressed up in high-heel shoes
And wearing my old hat
My four-year-old said, "I want a divorce"
Now where did she hear that?

[Chorus]
Kids say the darndest things
Have you ever listened close to the games they play
Or the little songs they sing?

[Verse 2]
Last night, as I watched TV
One rushed through the door
"Mommy, Daddy's telling someone on the phone
'Don't you call me here no more'"

[Chorus]
Kids say the darndest things
Have you ever listened close to the games they play
Or the little songs they sing?

[Verse 3]
Bet my daddy can whip your daddy
But Daddy's never home
And I think Mommy's worried 'bout him
'Cause she cried all night long

[Chorus]
Kids say the darndest things
Have you ever listened close to the games they play
Or the little songs they sing?

[Verse 4]
You never know what they learn at school
Or what they're thinking of
My first grader just said a four-letter word
And it sure wasn't love

[Chorus]
Kids say the darndest things
Have you ever listened close to the games they play
Or the little songs they sing?
Kids say the darndest things
