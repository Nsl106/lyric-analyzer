Good lovin' keeps a home together good lovin' sure can make it right
If you ever wanna be without him it means lovin' everything about him
That keeps your man around you tight

It takes a whole lotta women to hold it together today
Cause a lot of other women have a whiole lotta time to play
You gotta be saint on Sunday morning a devil on Saturday night
And when you love him do it right
Cause she's around at corner a wrapped in fur
And you've got to be just a little bit better than her
A little bit sweeter with morning kisses a whole lot warmer in the night
With a whole lotta good lovin' to make everything alright
Good lovin' keeps a home together...

If you don't believe what I'm tellin' you is so
Put your man right down the street and watch him go
Right to the arms of a woman who couldn't even hold you a light
When a lotta good lovin' would've made everything alright
If you don't believe...
Yeah a lotta good lovin' would've made everything alright
