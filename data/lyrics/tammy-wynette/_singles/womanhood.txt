Well, he said hold on, Patricia
I only tried to kiss ya
She said okay and then said don't you dare
She seems so badly shaking
He thought he was mistaken
But it sure looked like she bowed her head in prayer

I am a Christian, Lord
But I'm a woman too
If you are listening, Lord
Please show me what to do
I've tried hard to be what mama says is good
As I step into my womanhood

Shortly after midnight
She turned off the porch light
Walked into her bedroom all alone
She sat down and said
Well, Lord
God, I've been through hell, Lord
Wondering if I did right or wrong

I am a Christian
Lord, but I'm a woman too
If you are listening, Lord
Please show me what to do
I've tried hard to be what mama says is good
As I step into my womanhood
One more time

You heard, yes, I am a Christian, Lord
But I'm a woman too
If you are listening, Lord
Please show me what to do
I've tried hard to be what mama says is good
As I step into my womanhood

Slowly slip into my womanhood
Slowly slip into my womanhoo-oo-oo-ood...
