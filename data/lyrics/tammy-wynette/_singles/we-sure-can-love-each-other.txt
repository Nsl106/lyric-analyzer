We sure can love each other when we try just like in all the love songs when we try
And some nights I love you so much content to be beside you
And when I finally close my eyes the sun is high
But we sure can hurt each other when we try
We know all the ways to make each other cry
But when we forget compassion and to forgive is too old fashioned
We've let everything worth having pass us by
But we sure can love each other when we try
And I know we'll need each other till we die
And we'll grow old together you and I cause we sure can love each other when we try
Yes we sure can love each other when we try
