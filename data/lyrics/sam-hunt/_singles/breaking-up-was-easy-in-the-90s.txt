[Intro]
Yeah, man, oh man, oh man

[Verse 1]
Bartender looked at me like
"Pony up, man, we're closin' down"
I paid the tab, and I turned around
Got on that phone on the way home
And ended up down the rabbit hole again
It's funny how you haven't changed a bit
But you're twice as pretty
Glad you finally got to see New York City
And I know it's not a race
But it looks like you're gettin' over me
Faster than I'm gettin' over you
But hey, what you gon' do?

[Chorus]
I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

[Verse 2]
Back then, I could've convinced myself
That maybe you called when I was out
But you didn't know what to say, so you didn't leave a message
And that you're probably at home right now, sound asleep
'Cause goin' out isn't really your thing
And I wouldn't have a clue what you been up to lately
Or who you been up to it with
But when I don't miss your calls, I miss you callin'
And I go 'round and 'round again

[Chorus]
I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

[Bridge]
Modern love leads to modern hearts breakin'
I'm just a product of my generation, and I
'Bout had enough, watchin' you gettin' on with your life

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
I try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
(I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s)
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

[Outro]
Hearts breakin'
I'm a product of my
Oh, a product of my generation, oh, and I
My baby, my baby
