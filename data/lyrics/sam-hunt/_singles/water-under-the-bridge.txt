[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I can't believe this ol' road ain't washed out
That "No Trespassing" sign is still hangin' around
And it's doin' about as much as good now as it did back then
Yeah, and we used to load up on Natty, unleaded, and smokes
Hide from the sheriff and let down our folks
Parked some old Chevy jukebox up here on the bank
Crank it 'til that thing won't crank

[Chorus]
That muddy river, it was rollin'
We didn't care where it was goin'
We had it made, we didn't know it
We were young, dumb, and so full of it (Hey)
Broken bottles and graffiti
Beer and girls and poppin' wheelies
Love was fun and life was easy
Now it's just water under the bridge (Hey)

[Verse 2]
I kissed a girl my buddy used to like
He showed up out here and he wanted to fight
Now I still talk to him, but I don't know where she is
Guess it's just water under the bridge

[Chorus]
That muddy river, it was rollin'
We didn't care where it was goin'
We had it made, we didn't know it
We were young, dumb, and so full of it (Hey)
Broken bottles and graffiti
Beer and girls and poppin' wheelies
Love was fun and life was easy
Now it's just water under the bridge
Just water under the bridge

[Bridge]
Ooh yeah, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh yeah

[Chorus]
That muddy river, it was rollin'
We didn't care where it was goin'
We had it made, we didn't know it
We were young, dumb, and so full of it
Broken bottles and graffiti
Beer and girls and poppin' wheelies (Wheelies)
Love was fun and life was easy
Now it's just water under the bridge
Oh, just water under the bridge

[Outro]
Oh, it's just water under the bridge
Some days we used to come down here on Sunday nights
