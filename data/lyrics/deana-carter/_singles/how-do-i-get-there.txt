We've always been the best of friends
No secrets and no demands
But suddenly from somewhere out of the blue
I see a different light around you
One thing I haven't told you
I just want to hold you and never let go
I need to know

How do I get there from here?
How do I make you see?
How do I tell you what my heart's been telling me?
Lost in your lovin' arms
That's where I wanna be
You know I love you
How do I get there?

You probably think I've lost my mind
Takin' this chance
Crossin' that line
But I promise to be truer than true
Dreaming every night with these arms around you
I can't wait any longer this feeling's getting stronger
Help me find a way

How do I get there from here?
How do I make you see?
How do I tell you what my heart's been telling me?
Lost in your lovin' arms
That's where I wanna be
You know I love you
How do I get there?

I know the shortest distance
Between two points is a straight line
But I'll climb any mountain that you want me to climb
The perfect combination is your heart and mine
Darlin', won't you give me a sign?

How do I get there from here?
How do I make you see?
How do I tell you what my heart's been telling me?
Lost in your lovin' arms
That's where I wanna be
You know I love you
How do I get there?
