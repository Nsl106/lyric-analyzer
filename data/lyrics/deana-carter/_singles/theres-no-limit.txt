If it's a long long road
Baby I'll walk it
If it's a mountain high
Baby I'll cross it
If it's a deep blue sky
You know I'll jump out in it
There's nothing I would not do for you
There's no limit

If you want my heart
You can have it
If you want my soul
You gotta grab it
If you want my love
Then baby come and get it
There's nothing I would not do for you
There's no limit

Let's pack that Pontiac and say goodbye to Hollywood
Climb into the back and just get on with feeling good

(Instrumental)

Let's pack that Pontiac and bid goodbye to Hollywood
Slide into the back there's nothing wrong with feeling good...
Feelin' good

If it's a beat-up heart
I'll mend it
If it's a broken smile
I'll bend it
If it's a barbed wire fence
You know I'll take my chances
There's nothing I would not do...
'Cause honey you're living proof
There's no limit...mmmhmmm

If it's a long long road
You can have it
If it's a mountain high
You gotta grab it
If it's a deep blue sky
Take your chances (there's no limit)
Ooh ooh ooh

If it's a long long road
There's no limit (there's no limit)
There's no limit (3x)
