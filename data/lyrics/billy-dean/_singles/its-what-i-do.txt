[Verse 1]
Well, I knew a man, he was a real go-getter
And what he did best was climb the ladder of success
And how far he went was how he measured
The worth of his life and who he was
But that's all behind me now, because

[Chorus]
Loving you, it's what I do
It's the one thing I found I can put my heart into
It's who I am, I'm a lucky man living the life I choose
Loving you, it's what I do

[Verse 2]
I do what I can to make an honest living
It's just a job, it's not what I am living for
I wanna earn the love you're giving
That's all that matters now to me
No matter what, I'll always be

[Chorus]
Loving you, it's what I do
It's the one thing I found I can put my heart into
It's who I am, I'm a lucky man living the life I choose
Loving you, it's what I do

[Outro]
Loving you, it's what I do
