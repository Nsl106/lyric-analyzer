I remember as a child on a dark stormy night
I heard the screendoor slam and I was overcome with fright
So afraid that someone bad was trying to get in
And momma came to comfort me and said
"It's only the wind, and nothing more
Not the end of the world knockin' at the door
So close your eyes and dream again
Believe me, It's only the wind"

Everytime I'e had to face a bitter storm of life
Those words of comfort were my shelter in the night
But tonight I don't believe I'm able to pretend
The storm that you and I are up against is only the wind

I can hear you downstairs and you're just about to leave
There's nothing else that I can do to keep you here with me, no
And now the screen door's slammin' and I'm frightened once again
What I wouldn't give if I could be convinced

It's only the wind, and nothing more
Not the end of the world walking out the door
I wish that I could dream again
Believin' it's only the wind
Oh,nothing more, not the end of my world
Walking out the door
I wish that I could dream again
Believin' it's only the wind
Only the wind
