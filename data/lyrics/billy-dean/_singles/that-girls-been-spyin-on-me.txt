[Verse 1]
How does she know what makes me laugh?
Yes, and how does she know where to scratch my back?
How did she figure me out so easily?
I swear that girl's been spyin' on me

[Verse 2]
Where did she get those big blue eyes?
And how does she know what I like?
How could anybody fit me right to a t?
I swear that girl's been spyin' on me

[Chorus]
'Cause she been usin' information
I had locked up deep inside
To be the perfect woman
That I've been lookin' for all my life
Maybe we're two people meant to be
Either that or that girl's been spyin' on me

[Verse 3]
Now she knows all my inner thoughts
'Cause she got ways of makin' me talk
While she remains a mystery
I swear that girl's been spyin' on me

[Chorus]
'Cause she been usin' information
I had locked up deep inside
To be the perfect woman
That I've been lookin' for all my life
Maybe we're two people meant to be
Either that or that girl's been spyin' on me
