[Verse 1]
I can remember when you fit in the palm of my hand
You felt so good in it; no bigger than a minute
How it amazes me you're changin' with every blink
Faster than a flower blooms, they grow up all too soon

[Chorus]
So let them be little
Cause they're only that way for a while
Give 'em hope, give them praise
Give them love every day
Let 'em cry, let 'em giggle
Let 'em sleep in the middle
Oh, but let them be little

[Verse 2]
I never felt so much in one little tender touch
I live for those kisses, your prayers and your wishes
And now you're teachin' me how only a child can see
Tonight, while we're on our knees, all I ask is

[Chorus]
Please, let them be little
Cause they're only that way for a while
Give them hope, give them praise
Give them love every day
Let 'em cry, let 'em giggle
Let 'em sleep in the middle
Oh, but let them be little

[Post Chorus]
The so innocent, precious soul
You turn around, and it's time to let them go

[Chorus]
So let them be little
Cause they're only that way for a while
Give them hope, give 'em praise
Give them love every day
Let 'em cry, let 'em giggle
Let them sleep in the middle
Oh, but let them be little
Let them be little
