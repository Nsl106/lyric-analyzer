[Verse 1]
Through the back window of our '59 wagon
I watched my best friend Jamie slipping further away
I kept on waving till I couldn't see her
And through my tears I asked again why we couldn't stay

[Bridge]
Mama whispered softly time will ease your pain
Life's about changing nothing ever stays the same

[Chorus]
And she said how can I help you to say goodbye?
It's okay to hurt and it's okay to cry
Come let me hold you and I will try
How can I help you to say goodbye?

[Verse 2]
I sat on our bed he packed his suitcase
I held a picture of our wedding day
His hands were trembling we both were crying
He kissed me gently and then he quickly walked away

[Bridge]
I called up mama and she said time will ease your pain
Life's about changing nothing ever stays the same

[Chorus]
And she said how can I help you to say goodbye?
It's okay to hurt and it's okay to cry
Come let me hold you and I will try
How can I help you to say goodbye?

[Verse 3]
Sitting with mama alone in her bedroom
She opened her eyes and then squeezed my hand
She said I have to go now my time here is over
And with her final words she tried to help me understand

[Bridge]
Mama whispered softly, time will ease your pain
Life's about changing nothing ever stays the same

[Chorus]
And she said how can I help you to say goodbye?
It's okay to hurt and it's okay to cry
Come let me hold you and I will try
How can I help you to say goodbye?
