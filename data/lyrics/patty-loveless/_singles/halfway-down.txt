[Verse 1]
Raindrops on the treetops
Waitin' there to fall
I know how they're feeling
But I'm only, yes, I'm only
Halfway down

[Verse 2]
Fightin' with the devil
Harder all the time
Sinkin' to his level
But I'm only, yes, I'm only
Halfway down

[Chorus]
Halfway down, just a-gettin' started
Yes, I'm beginnin' on my journey now
But I've only gotten halfway down
Halfway down, just a little bit farther
Well, I believe you better catch me now
'Cause I'm only goin' halfway down

[Verse 3]
Sippin' shallow water
Sharks out for the kill
Almost hittin' bottom
But I'm only, yes, I'm only
Halfway down

[Chorus]
Halfway down, just a-gettin' started
Yes, I'm beginnin' on my journey now
But I've only gotten halfway down
Halfway down, just a little bit farther
Well, I believe you better catch me now
'Cause I'm only goin' halfway down
Yeah, I hope you better catch me now
'Cause I'm only goin' halfway down
Yes, I'm only goin' halfway down
Yes, I'm only goin' halfway down
