[Verse 1]
The right time, the right place
The right body, the right face
Timber I'm falling in love

[Verse 2]
It started slow, it's coming fast
I got a feelin' it's gonna last
Timber I'm falling in love

[Chorus]
You're so pretty, you look so sweet
Your love's sweepin' me off of my feet
You're the only one I'm dreamin' of
I can't believe that I'm falling in love

[Verse 3]
Who knows how love starts
I woke up with you in my heart
Timber I'm falling in love

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You're so pretty, you look so sweet
Your love's sweepin' me off of my feet
You're the only one I'm dreamin' of
I can't believe that I'm falling in love

[Verse 3]
Who knows how love starts
I woke up with you in my heart
Timber I'm falling in love

[Outro]
Timber I'm falling in love
Timber I'm falling in love
