[Verse 1]
When you know and you will
It wasn't meant to be
When she walks and she will
You're gonna come to me

[Verse 2]
When she lies and she will
When all is said and done
When you cry and you will
You're gonna want to run

[Chorus]
So go ahead and do what you gotta do
It's really not up to me
But the day will come when you finally see
Where you want to be
When you're gonna be back

[Verse 3]
When you hurt and you will
Who's gonna sympathize
Well she won't but I will
Then you'll realize

[Chorus]
So go ahead and do what you gotta do
It's really not up to me
But the day will come when you finally see
Where you want to be
Then you're gonna be back

[Bridge]
(She lies, she will)
I know you will
I just know you will

[Chorus]
So go ahead and do what you gotta do
It's really not up to me
But the day will come when you finally see
Where you want to be
Then you're gonna be back

[Outro]
(When she lies, and she will)
And you know you she will
(When you hurt, and you will)
I know, I know, I know you will
(I know you will)
I know you will
(I know you will)
(I know you will)
