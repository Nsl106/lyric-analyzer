You should have seen it coming, now it's too late
She bought the half-price ticket on the midnight train
You wouldn't understand 'cause you lie and cheat
So she wrote it out in lipstick on your satin sheets

She drew a broken heart
She drew a broken heart
Torn right down the middle in a red jagged line
She drew a broken heart and put your name inside

She had to draw you a picture to make it sink in
Revlon rose was her poison pen
For God's gift to women you ain't got a clue
That red broken heart belongs to you

She drew a broken heart
She drew a broken heart
It ain't no cupid's arrow, it ain't no valentine
She drew a broken heart and put your name inside

No lovesick words gonna bring her back
The buck stops here, buddy, that's a fact
No matter who's right, no matter who's wrong
Anyway you cut it, she's gone

She drew a broken heart
She drew a broken heart
Torn right down the middle in a red jagged line
She drew a broken heart and put your name inside

Right down the middle
Right down the line
She drew a broken heart and put your name inside
Whoa, she's gone
