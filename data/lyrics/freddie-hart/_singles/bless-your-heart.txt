Bless your heart for loving me
Ad heaven knows I don't deserve you
Bless your heart for loving me
Sweet sweet baby I'll try to be worthy of loving you

You came into my life and took the world off of my shoulders
Honey you're an angel in the eyes of this beholder
Bless your heart for loving me
More words cannot express what you are worth
Bless your heart for loving me
I know I've been given a taste of heaven right here on earth
Bless your heart
