I get the greatest feeling
A simple kind of feeling
And it's because I've got a
Super kind of woman

She came to me so gently and so swee-eet
Easy loving swept me off my fee-ee-eet
It was so natural for me to love her
I was always thinking of her
With her beside me now that's all I need

With her, I get the greatest feeling
A simple kind of feeling
And it's because she is a
Super kind of woman

I love that girl with all my heart and sou-oul
With her I am no longer half a who-o-ole
She gives me strength to face tomorrow
She comforts me in times of sorrow
With her beside me life is worth it all

With her, I get the greatest feeling
A simple kind of feeling
And it's because I've got a
Super kind of woman
A super kind of woman
