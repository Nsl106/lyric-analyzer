I just took a trip to heaven I didn't even have to die

How does it grab you baby can't you believe what's goin' on
Did you get that so good feeling it's coming on so strong
Ain't this loving really something I think my heart just touched the sky
I just took a trip to heaven I didn't even have to die

If I'm dreaming please don't wake me love may never come again
Hang on we'll ride together to a sweet or bitter end
Loving you performed a miracle I don't need no wings to fly
I just took a trip to heaven I din't even have to die
If I'm dreaming...
I just took a trip to heaven I didn't even have to die
