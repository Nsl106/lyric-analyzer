[Verse 1]
Square bales, flatbeds
Clothesline, sunsets
Sky blue, barn red
Wind chimes, front porch
Good dogs, wood floors
Work boots, open doors
And miles and miles of John Deere green
Freedom far as I can see
A road to run and room to breathe
That's who I am and I'll always be

[Chorus]
Caught up in the country
The only way I wanna be
Somewhere where the road ends
Out there where the creek bends
That's where you can find me
With them fields of gold and cotton rows
That never ending sky
I take it slow and easy roaming this life
Caught up in the country

[Verse 2]
Just look at 'em stars
Must be a billion of 'em
They just doing they thing
Right where God put 'em

[Pre-Chorus]
If this ain't heaven it's halfway there
You can feel it in the air

[Chorus]
Caught up in the country
The only way I wanna be
Somewhere where the road ends
Out there where the creek bends
That's where you can find me (Find me)
With them fields of gold and cotton rows
That never ending sky
I take it slow and easy roaming this life
Caught up in the country (I was brought up in it)
Caught up in the country (Oh and good Lord willin')
(Yes I am my way, I'll stay)
(Caught up in it, caught up in it)
Somewhere where the road ends
Out there where the creek bends
That's where you can find me (I was brought up in it)

[Verse 3]
With them fields of gold and cotton rows
That never ending sky
I take it slow and easy roaming this life
Miles and miles of John Deere green
(Caught up in the country)
Freedom far as I can see
(Caught up in the country)
A road to run and room to breathe
That's who I am and I'll always be

[Outro]
(Caught up in the country)
(Caught up in the country)
(Caught up in the country)
(in this life)
Caught up in the country
