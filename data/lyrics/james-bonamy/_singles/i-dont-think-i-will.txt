Hold it right there
Don't say a word
I hear a voice I've never heard
Calling my name
Saying this is the one
Oh my goodness what have you done
I could turn around and walk away
Saying this is too good to be real
But oh no I don't think I will

Because I absolutely, positively know without a doubt
You're becoming someone I just could not live without
I was so afraid I'd spend my whole life not knowing how this feels
Oh no, I don't think I will

I could just do what I've done before
Blame it all on the moon
Say it's nothing more
Than the pull of the tide
And it's gonna pass
But something's telling me
This time it's gonna last
I could close my eyes and just pretend I don't feel the way I feel
But oh no, I don't think I will

Because I absolutely, positively know without a doubt
You're becoming someone I just could not live without
I was so afraid I'd spend my whole life not knowing how this feels
Oh no, I don't think I will

Oh no I don't think
Oh ya I don't think I
Oh no I don't think I will
