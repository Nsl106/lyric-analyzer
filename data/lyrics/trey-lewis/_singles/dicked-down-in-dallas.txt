[Verse 1]
I bet she didn't think twice about Amarillo
Hell, Denver all but once crossed her mind
She's flyin' down 40 like a bat outta hell for Memphis
She left me all alone in Montgomery tonight

[Chorus]
She's gettin' dicked down in Dallas, railed out in Raleigh
Tag teamed up in Tennessee
Analed in Austin, buttfucked in Boston
Givin' neck down in New Orleans
Puttin' me through hell, fuckin' someone else
Now I'm the one on my knees
Prayin' she'll come back, gimmе that sweet ass
But I already know that she's gettin' dickеd down in Dallas

[Post-Chorus]
Dicked down, dicked down in Dallas
Dicked down, dicked down in Dallas

[Verse 2]
She's probably in the Lone Star State
Suckin' off ol' what's his name
I wonder what her daddy'd say
Maybe he's the one to blame

[Chorus]
She's gettin' dicked down in Dallas, railed out in Raleigh
Tag teamed up in Tennessee
Analed in Austin, buttfucked in Boston
Givin' neck down in New Orleans
Puttin' me through hell, fuckin' someone else
Now I'm the one on my knees
Prayin' she'll come back, gimme that sweet ass
But I already know that she's gettin' dicked down in Dallas

[Post-Chorus]
(Dicked down, dicked down in Dallas)
Yeah, dicked down in Dallas (Dicked down, dicked down in Dallas)
(Dicked down, dicked down in Dallas)
(Dicked down, dicked down in Dallas)

[Chorus]
Dicked down in Dallas, railed out in Raleigh
Tag teamed up in Tennessee
Analed in Austin, buttfucked in Boston
Givin' neck down in New Orleans
Puttin' me through hell, fuckin' someone else
Now I'm the one on my knees
Prayin' she'll come back, gimme that sweet ass
But I already know that she's gettin' dicked down in Dallas

[Outro]
(Dicked down, dicked down in Dallas) Yeah, dicked down in Dallas
(Dicked down, dicked down in Dallas) She's dicked down in Dallas
(Dicked down, dicked down in Dallas) Dicked down in Dallas
(Dicked down, dicked down)
