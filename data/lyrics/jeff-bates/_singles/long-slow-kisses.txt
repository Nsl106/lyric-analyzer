[Verse 1: Jeff Bates, spoken]
Hey baby, I guess you're wondering
What I'm doing home so soon; no I ain't sick
It's just this morning when you told me
You didn't feel like you were the most important thing in my life

[Verse 2: Jeff Bates, spoken]
And you know what
That well broke my heart
So I had to turn around and come back
And tell you what I'm gonna do about it

[Chorus: Jeff Bates]
I'm gonna light the bedroom candles
Take the phone out of the wall
We'll lay around and talk for hours
Or maybe we won't talk at all
I'm gonna resurrect the love
That slipped away from us
And the man you've been missing
Starting with some long, slow kisses

[Verse 3: Jeff Bates, spoken]
I just wanna let you know how ashamed I am
For making you feel that way darling, I'm so sorry
I guess I've just been spending too much time on making a living
And way too little on making love

[Verse 4: Jeff Bates, spoken]
But if you can find it in your heart
To forgive me girl
I swear from this moment on
You'll always know where you stand with me

[Chorus: Jeff Bates]
I'm gonna light the bedroom candles
Take the phone out of the wall
We'll lay around and talk for hours
Or maybe we won't talk at all
I'm gonna resurrect the love
That slipped away from us
And the man you've been missing
Starting with some long, slow kisses

[Verse 5: Jeff Bates]
'Cause what really matters most
Is you and me this close
Feeling no distance
Sharing some long, slow kisses
Sharing some long, slow kisses
