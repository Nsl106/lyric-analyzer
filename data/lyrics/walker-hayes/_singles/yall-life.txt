[Intro]
Y’all life, y'all
Hey

[Verse 1]
Small town, y'all town, double dutch in the park
Ice cream truck failing that emissions test hard
It's a blow up Grinch in the yard and it's March
Ain't comin' down anytime soon

[Verse 2]
Y'all, them nursing homes still rattling with some Dolly Parton
And them high school kids traveling like James Harden
In them white limousines to the Olive Garden
On prom night (Woo), it's good times, right

[Chorus]
We be livin' that y'all life, y'all (Hey)
Rollin' in the South
Where it's all football and Jesus (Jesus)
Barbershop talking like nah
Shut your mouth, my mama's sweet tea's the sweetest
Turn that bass up, shawty, show 'em how (Show 'em how)
Y'all, we raise up (Up) and, y'all, we goin' down, down, baby
Yo' street in my Bronco
I'ma talk to ya real slow
Said where the crawdads crawl (Ooh)
Said living that y'all life, y'all (Y'all life, y'all)

[Verse 3]
Y'all all them dads tell them boys, "Son, walk it off"
Y'all all them mamas tell them girls, "Better keep your legs crossed"
All them hands in the stands prayin' for the coin toss
Lord please (Please), "We want the ball at the half"

[Verse 4]
Say y'all, it's all about a dub and a dirt road
And amen in a church on the third row (Amen on the third row)
With your arm around your girl like a fur coat (Let's pray)
On a Sunday, come Monday

[Chorus]
We be livin' that y'all life, y'all
Rollin' in the South
Where it's all football and Jesus (Jesus)
Barbershop talking like nah
Shut your mouth, my mama's sweet tea's the sweetest
Turn that bass up, shawty, show 'em how (Show 'em how)
Y'all, we raise up (Up) and, y'all, we goin' down, down, baby
Yo' street in my Bronco
I'ma talk to ya real slow (Real slow)
Said where the crawdads crawl
Said living that y'all life, y'all (Y'all life, y'all)

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh)
Y'all life, y'all life
(Oh)
Y'all life, y'all life

[Bridge]
Said y'all, I got that Wiffle ball, bat flip swag in my walk
Down in 'Bama where they grammar got some country in it, y'all
'Nana puddin', prayer chains, tailgates in them jeans
Ain't no thang (Ain't no thang)
But a chicken wing, nah
(Ain't no thang but a chicken wing)

[Chorus]
We be livin' that y'all life, y'all (Hey)
Rollin' in the South
Where it's all football and Jesus (Jesus)
Barbershop talking like nah
Shut your mouth, my mama's sweet tea's the sweetest
Turn that bass up (Up), shawty, show 'em how (Show 'em how)
Y'all, we raise up (Up) and, y'all, we goin' down, down, baby
Yo' street in my Bronco
I'ma talk to ya real slow (Real slow)
Said where the crawdads crawl
Said living that y'all life, y'all (Y'all life, y'all)
