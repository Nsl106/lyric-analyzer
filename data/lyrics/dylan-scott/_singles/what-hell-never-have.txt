[Verse 1]
Girl, I meant what I said
When I said, "I do."
Yeah, through thick or thin
I'd spend forever with you
But if I leave this world
Baby, a little too soon
It hurts like hell to say, "I hope you find someone new."

[Chorus]
He can have my truck, sitting out in the drive
He can have this house, everything inside
My favorite fishing hole and my old dog too
But what he'll never have is the love I have for you

[Verse 2]
Girl, I hope and pray
You and me grow old
Few lines on our face
Few million stories told
But if I leavе this place
Find another hand to hold
It hurts like hеll to say, but make sure he knows

[Chorus]
He can have my truck, sitting out in the drive
He can have this house, everything inside
My favorite fishing hole and my old dog too
But what he'll never have is the love I have for you

[Bridge]
Hope he's half the man as me
But, baby, there's no way he'll see what I see
He can pile up my stuff or burn it all down
'Cause, girl, your love's all I'll take to the ground

[Chorus]
He can have my truck, sitting out in the drive
He can have this house, everything inside
My favorite fishing hole and my old dog too
But what he'll never have is the love I have for you

Have for you
