[Verse 1]
Baby, I see them boys
They always lookin' at you
But I ain’t causin' a scene
'Cause girl, I’m the one that's with you
They can shoot you a wink, they can buy you a drink
Try to steal your attention
They can talk a big talk, they can walk a big walk
But I know you ain't going home with 'em

[Chorus]
Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do
Yeah, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do
I'ma love you 'til the good Lord comes back for me and you
Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do

[Verse 2]
I know how you like your coffee
And how hot you like your bath
I know what makes you angry
And what makes you laugh
I know the taste of your lips, every inch of your skin
The little things that turn you on
I know that look in your eyes when they look back at mine
Saying baby, take me home

[Chorus]
Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do
Yeah, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do
I'ma love you 'til the good Lord comes back for me and you
Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do

[Bridge]
I’m gonna love you, love you
The only way that I know
I’m gonna love you, love you
Like there's no tomorrow
Yeah, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do

[Chorus]
Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do
Yeah, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do (Like I do)
I’ma love you 'til the good Lord comes back for me and you
Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do
Yeah, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I
