[Verse 1]
Gave us that hilltop place to park
Gave us them girls that stole our hearts
Gave us them bucks up on the wall
The way we live and the way we talk
Gave us state that senior year
Them country stores to buy that beer
A place to go nobody knows
When you take it in and you take it

[Pre-Chorus]
Slow like that river rolls
Where that green grass grows
I can't explain it
Aw, it's something ain't it

[Chorus]
Yeah, we sure painted it up
Tore down them old two-lane roads
We either stole every sign or left 'em in bullet holes
It wasn't nowhere as bad as we all said that it was
Yeah, looking back at it now this town's been too good to us
Raised hell on the weekends, yeah
Man, what were we thinkin' when we said we'd leave it in a cloud of dust
This town's been too good to us
(Too good to us)

[Verse 2]
Good people in a back row pew
Good dirt that the corn grows through
Good water that can wash away our sins
Good times with some damn good friends
Whole lot of not too much to do
All the time in the world to do it
Every bit of that down-home dirt was heaven on earth
And we never knew it

[Chorus]
Yeah, we sure painted it up
Tore down them old two-lane roads
We either stole every sign or left 'em in bullet holes
It wasn't nowhere as bad as we all said that it was
Yeah, looking back at it now this town's been too good to us
Raised hell on the weekends, yeah
Man, what were we thinking when we said we'd leave it in a cloud of dust
This town's been too good to us
Too good to us

[Pre-Chorus]
Slow like that river rolls
Where that green grass grows
I can't explain it
Aw, it's something ain't it
(Something ain't it, something ain't it)

[Chorus]
Yeah, we sure painted it up
Tore down them old two-lane roads
We either stole every sign or left 'em in bullet holes
It wasn't nowhere as bad as we all said that it was
Yeah, looking back at it now this town's been too good to us
Raised hell on the weekends, yeah
Man, what were we thinking when we said we'd leave it in a cloud of dust
This town's been too good to us
Yeah, too good to us (To us, to us)
This town's been too good to us
