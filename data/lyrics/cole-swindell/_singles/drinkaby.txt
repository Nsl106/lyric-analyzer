[Verse 1]
I got a song, I'm 'bout to sing it
She left a note, so I started drinkin'
Bartender, pour anything you want on ice
I got a song and it goes like

[Pre-Chorus]
Jack, Jim, 'quila lime, apple pie, this is my
Gettin'-over-her-'til-I'm-passed-out drinkaby

[Chorus]
Bye, my baby's long gone
Sadder than a steel in a country song
Raise your glasses to the rafters and help me sing along tonight
To my drinkaby

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I don't know where she's at, could be Kentucky
But all I know is I might get lucky
'Cause I'm two shots in with a ten from Mississippi
That'll drink Patrón, get me gone, and sing along with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Goin' Jack, Jim, 'quila lime, apple pie, this is my
Gettin'-over-her-'til-I'm-passed-out drinkaby

[Chorus]
Bye, my baby's long gone
Sadder than a steel in a country song
Raise your glasses to the rafters and help me sing along tonight
To my drinkaby, yeah
My drinkaby

[Bridge]
Oh, let's go
Hush, little cowboy, don't you cry
Bartender's got you some whiskey on ice
And if that whiskey ain't a big enough pour
Drink another and another 'til you're laid out on the floor
Come on
This is my drinkaby

[Pre-Chorus]
And it goes like
Jack, Jim, 'quila lime, apple pie, this is my
Gettin'-over-her-'til-I'm-passed-out drinkaby

[Chorus]
Bye, my baby's long gone
Sadder than a steel in a Haggard song
Raise your glasses to the rafters and help me sing along tonight
To my drinkaby (Bye, bye, my baby's long gone)
Yeah, my drinkaby, bye, bye (Sadder than a steel in a country song)
Raise your glasses to the rafters and help me sing along tonight
To my drinkaby
Yeah, my drinkaby

[Outro]
Oh, my drinkaby
