[Verse 1]
You ever seen a prayer in person?
Kind of thing that makes you believe
All the waitin' 'round was worth it
One of them meant-to-be's
Mine showed up out of nowhere
In just a T-shirt and some jeans
And I knew right then, right there
She looked like forever to me

[Chorus]
She gave eighteen summers to Carolina
Spent a few more wild and free
Gave a long shot chance to a Georgia boy in Tennessee
I gave a promisе to her daddy
And a grass stain to my knee
I mighta gave her thе diamond, but she gave forever to me

[Verse 2]
Well, there ain't no dancin' 'round it
When your whole world standin' there
Just 'cause we've talked about it
Didn't mean I wasn't scared
And right there where I met her
Yeah, I showed her the ring
Just waitin' on her answer, Lord, felt like forever to me

[Chorus]
Yeah, she gave eighteen summers to Carolina
Spent a few more wild and free
Gave a long shot chance to a Georgia boy in Tennessee
I gave a promise to her daddy
And a grass stain to my knee
I might've gave her the diamond, but she gave forever to me, yeah
She gave forever to me

[Bridge]
She gave a "yes" to the dress with her mama
That's gonna be somethin' to see
She gave her heart to Jesus
And He gave her to me
I wish you coulda met my daddy
Know how happy he would be
That I gave her a diamond and she gave forever to me

[Outro]
(She gave forever to me)
