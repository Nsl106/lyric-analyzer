Anyway the wind blows
Anyway the wind blows

Back when we were wild and ready
On the edge of a dust bowl city
Cadillac rollin steady
Anyway the wind blows

Life was an infinite number
Livin one day to another
Lookin for the end of summer
And we can't see around the bend
We never know where the road might end
We just go any way the wind blows

Burnin both ends of the candle
Can't worry bout the things that we don't know
Going just as fast as we can go
Anyway the wind blows

Doesn't matter if we lead or follow
No telling where we'll be tomorrow
Goin somewhere, goin full throttle
Anyway the wind blows

And we don't know what lies in store
But still we walk through that open door
We just go anyway the wind blows

Who can say what might have been
We gotta play out the hand were given
Take a ride to the place were driven
And we can't see around the bend
We never know where the road might end
We just go any way the wind blows
We just go any way the wind blows
We just go any way the wind blows
Anyway the wind blows

Ooohh
Any way the wind blows (Anyway the wind blows)
Any way the wind blows (Ain't no telling where we'll be tomorrow)
Any way the wind blows (Anyway)
Anyway the wind blows
Ooohh
Anyway the wind blows
