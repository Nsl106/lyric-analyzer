[Verse 1]
Hey, I've been around, I've seen it all
Love is a chain around your heart
That holds you down, you're better off
Runnin' away before it starts
I wanted to chase my dreams
I thought freedom meant everything

[Chorus]
But hey, hey what do I know?
I'm just a lonely fool that let you go
And now what do I do?
Thought i could live without you
But what do I know?

[Verse 2]
Look who I've become, I wanted it all
Oh, but it hasn't happened yet
Look what I've done, I've built a wall
In between me and happiness
I had the answers, I made the rules
And I thought I had nothing to lose

[Chorus]
But hey, hey what do I know?
I'm just a lonely fool that let you go
And now what do I do?
Thought i could live without you
But what do I know?

[Bridge]
I had the answers, I made the rules
And I thought I had nothing to lose

[Chorus]
But hey, hey what do I know?
I'm just a lonely fool that let you go
And now what do I do?
Thought i could live without you
But what do I know?
