[Verse 1]
Can't concentrate on the preacher preaching
My attention span done turned off
I'm honed in on that angel singing
Up there in the choir loft

[Chorus]
She's got her daddy's money, her mama's good looks
More laughs than a stack of comic books
A wild imagination, a college education
Add it all up, it's a deadly combination
She's a good bass fisher, a dynamite kisser
Country as a turnip green
She's got her daddy's money, her mama's good looks
And look who's lookin' at me

[Verse 2]
Her second cousin was my third grade teacher
I used to cut her grandma's grass
Back then she was nothin' but knees and elbows
Golly did she grow up fast

[Chorus]
She's got her daddy's money, her mama's good looks
More laughs than a stack of comic books
A wild imagination, a college education
Add it all up, it's a deadly combination
She's a good bass fisher, a dynamite kisser
Country as a turnip green
She's got her daddy's money, her mama's good looks
And look who's lookin' at me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Lord, if you got any miracles handy
Maybe you could grant me one
Just let me walk down the aisle and say, "I do"
To that angel with a choir robe on

[Chorus]
She's got her daddy's money, her mama's good looks
More laughs than a stack of comic books
A wild imagination, a college education
Add it all up, it's a deadly combination
She's a good bass fisher, a dynamite kisser
Country as a turnip green
She's got her daddy's money, her mama's good looks
And look who's lookin' at me

[Outro]
She's got her daddy's money, her mama's good looks
And she's lookin' at me
