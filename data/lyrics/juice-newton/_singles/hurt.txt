I'm hurt
To think that you lied to me
I'm hurt
Way down deep inside of me

You said
Our love was true
And we'd never ever part
And now
You want someone new
And it breaks my heart

I'm hurt
Much more than you'll ever know
I'm hurt
Because I still love you so

But even though you've hurt me
Like nobody else could do
I would never, never hurt you

But even though you've hurt me
Like nobody else could ever do
I would never, never hurt, hurt you
