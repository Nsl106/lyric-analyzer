[Verse 1]
We don't have each other's numbers anymore
We don't make any plans Friday night
And I won't know you when you're turning sixty-four
But nobody knew you better at twenty-five

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I'd be lying if I said
That you don't wind up in my head
We don't dream about tomorrow like before
All we have is looking back and that's alright

[Chorus]
'Cause we got spring break '08, down in Pensacola
Drunk and singing Breakfast at Tiffany's
Yeah, we got so high, first time back of your Corolla
Told me, "Baby, don't you stop kissing me, kissing me"
I know we don't have a future anymore
But damn, we got history

[Verse 2]
Everybody's got that one they can't forget
That got away, I gotta say, you were mine
But you can't try to tell me yesterday is gone
When I still go there all the time

[Chorus]
'Cause we got spring break '08, down in Pensacola
Drunk and singing Breakfast at Tiffany's
Yeah, we got so high, first time back of your Corolla
Told me, "Baby, don't you stop kissing me, kissing me"
I know we don't have a future anymore
But damn, we got history

[Bridge]
Ooh, you know we got history, baby, yeah
And I'd be lying if I said
That you don't wind up in my head, hey

[Chorus]
'Cause we got spring break '08 down in Pensacola
Drunk and singing Breakfast at Tiffany's
Yeah, we got so high, first time back of your Corolla
Told me, "Baby, don't you stop kissing me, kissing me"
I know we don't have a future anymore
But damn, we got history (I know we got history, baby, yeah)

[Outro]
I know we don't have a future anymore
But damn, we got history
Yeah, girl, we got history
