[Verse 1]
We're like summer and winter
We're not one bit alike
We're like satin and cinders
I'm definitely not your type

[Chorus]
Well, then what are we doin' in love?
What are we doin' in a mess like this?
What are we doin' in love?
Why were you someone I couldn't resist?
What are we doin' in love?

[Verse 2]
We're like paper and matches
We'll probably have our share of fights
We're like roses and switches
It's gonna be hard but we've got to try

[Chorus]
So what are we doin' in love?
What are we doin' in a mess like this?
What are we doin' in love?
And what are we gonna tell all our friends?

[Bridge]
You don't have to like someone to love someone
That rule was made to be broken
But if we have to say goodbye to a life we've gotten used to
What are we doin' in love then?

[Verse 3]
We're like sun up and sun down
People say we're never gonna last
Like uptown and downtown
You like it slow, but I like it fast

[Chorus]
What are we doin' in love?
What are we doin' in a mess like this?
What are we doin' in love?
What are we gonna tell all our friends?
What are we doin' in love?
What are we doin' in a mess like this?
What are we doin' in love?
You were just someone I couldn't resist

[Outro]
So that's what we're doin' in love
