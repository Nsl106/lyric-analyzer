Are you happy baby
After what you put me through
Hope you're happy baby
Cause I don't believe you're gonna find anyone
Who loves you better than I do
Sometimes I wonder if you ever knew
How much you were hurtin' me
You fell in love with someone else
And just like that you deserted me
Haven't seen you for so long
Thought I'd call
I wonder, are you happy baby
Do you miss me a all
Oo Oo before you go now
I just gotta know now
Are you happy baby
Is she there to stand by you
Was it worth it baby
Well I don't believe you're gonna find anyone
Who loves you better than I do
Some friends of yours and mine say lately
Things with you ain't been so good
I told you I would never take you back again
But you know I would
Doesn't matter anymore who was wrong
I wonder are you happy baby
Don't you wanna come home
