[Verse 1]
We drove right past that no trespassing sign
We sat on the tailgate and watched the planes take off
We thought we had all night, there was no need to rush
That's when those cops came pulling up
And I thought
Man, ain't this some sh—

[Pre-Chorus]
Your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
Baby, yeah, I know it sounds crazy

[Chorus]
But there was something 'bout the way the blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

[Verse 2]
Man, they weren't playing, they sure threw those cuffs on quick
You tried to sweet talk 'em, they didn't fall for it, but I did
You were on the left, I was on the right
I knew you didn't smoke when you asked him for a light
And I laughed
He got mad and slammed the door

[Pre-Chorus]
I swear your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
Baby, yeah, I know it sounds crazy

[Chorus]
But there was something 'bout the way the blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-woah-oh)
Oh, and you were like (Oh-woah-oh)

[Bridge]
Side by side and locked in tight
They were taking their time, but we didn't mind
We talked and we laughed, we sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone (Yeah)

[Chorus]
But there was something 'bout the way the blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-woah-oh)
I fell in love in the back of a cop car
(Oh-woah-oh)

[Outro]
(Oh) And side by side and locked in tight
They were taking their time, but we didn't mind
We talked and we laughed, we sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone (Oh-woah-oh)
I was already gone, baby (Oh-woah-oh)
I fell in love in the back of a cop car
