[Verse 1]
I was so cold and lost
And nothing seemed to ring true
I couldn't bear the cross
For everything I'd been through
And each day, I knew I needed change
But there was no way, no way

[Chorus]
And then God whispered your name
And that's when everything changed
And love came out of the rain
And talk about being saved
Suddenly I wanna live
More than I ever did
I'm never gonna be the same
When God whispered your name

[Verse 2]
I can see the sunshine
For the first time in a while
Girl, it's like I've been baptized
By the warmth of your smile, hmm
Well, call it fate or faith or call it crazy either way
It's amazin', amazin' grace

[Chorus]
When God whispered your name
That's when everything changed
Love came out of the rain
Talk about being saved
Well, suddenly I wanna live
More than I ever did
I'm never gonna be the same
When God whispered your name

[Bridge]
It's just what I needed to hear, baby
It couldn't have been more loud and clear

[Chorus]
When God whispered your name
That's when everything changed
Love came out of the rain (Out of the rain)
And talk about being saved
Oh, suddenly I wanna live
More than I ever did
I'm never gonna be the same
When God whispered your name, oh yeah

[Outro]
(Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah)
Ooh, Hallelujah, baby
(Hallelujah) Oh, yeah, hmm-hmm (Hallelujah)
(Hallelujah) Ooh yeah
I can see the sunlight shinin' through your pretty eyes, baby
(Hallelujah) Woo, hmm (Hallelujah)
I like a man who leaves, time feels like Hell
(Hallelujah) Got my hands up high, I got my hands up to the sky
(Hallelujah) Ooh, I'm sayin' thank you (Hallelujah)
(Hallelujah)
(Hallelujah, Hallelujah)
(Hallelujah)
