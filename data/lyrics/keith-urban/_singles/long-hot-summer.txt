[Verse 1]
I can't sleep, ain't no sleep a-comin'
I’m just lying here thinking about you
I’m in deep, falling deep into the picture
In my mind of everything we’re going to do

Over at the lake and down by the river
You can feel it start to rise
Want to jump in my car, go wherever you are
Because I need you by my side

[Chorus]
It’s going to be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, it’s such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day
I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind
Just waiting for the sun to go down
The sun to go down

[Verse 2]
I want to see your brown skin shimmer
In the sun for the first time
I gotta be the one who knows just what to do to you
To get me that smile
One chance of meetin', you were walkin' by me
On the street and I said "Hi"
And that was the beginning of my heart spinning
Like these wheels in my head tonight

[Chorus]
It’s going to be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, it’s such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day
I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind
Just waiting for the sun to go down
The sun to go down

[Bridge]
The only place that I want to be is where you are
'Cause any more than a heartbeat away is just too far

[Chorus]
It's gonna be a long hot summer, we should be together (Unh, Unh Uh, Unh, Unh Uh)
All I really want is more than this moment right now

'Cause when you say my name in the middle of the day
I swear I see the stars come out
And when your holdin' my hand and I look into your eyes
I swear it looks like you're waitin' on the sun to go down
The sun to go down, (Ooh, ooh)

[Outro]
Oh, I swear it looks like you're waitin' on the sun to go down
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh
Hey, yeah
Oh, I’m loving thinking about you (Oh, Oh)
I can't sleep, I’m just lying here thinking about you
