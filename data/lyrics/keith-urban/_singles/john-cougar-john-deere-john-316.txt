[Verse 1]
I'm a 45 spinning on an old Victrola
I'm a two-strike swinger, I'm a Pepsi Cola
I'm a blue jean quarterback sayin', "I love you" to the prom queen
In a Chevy
I'm John Wayne, Superman, California
I'm a Kris Kristofferson, Sunday morning
I'm a mama and daddy singin' along to Don McLean
At the levee

[Chorus]
And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden
Never grow up, never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open
On a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, hey
Everything I needed
That's right

[Verse 2]
I'm Mark Twain on the Mississippi
I'm Hemingway with a shot of whiskey
I'm a TV dinner on a tray tryna figure out the Wheel of Fortune
I'm a Texaco star, I'm a Gibson guitar
I'm still a teenage kid tryna go too far
I'm a jukebox waiting in a neon bar, for a quarter

[Chorus]
And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden
Never grow up, never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16

[Bridge]
I spent a lot of years running from believing
Looking for another way to save my soul
The longer I live, the more I see it
There's only one way home

[Chorus]
And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden
Never grow up, never grow old, oh
Just another rebel in the great wide open
On a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16
Mm, oh
Oh, I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe (Marilyn Monroe) and the Garden of Eden
Never grow up, never grow old (Never grow old)
Another rebel in the great wide open
On a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16

[Outro]
(John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16)
Everything I needed
(John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16)
Everything I needed
(John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16)
Oh, that's right
