[Verse 1]
To kiss and tell, it's just not my style
But the night is young, and it's been awhile
And she broke my heart, broke it right in two
And it took some time but I'm feeling like I'm
Finally ready to find, find somebody new

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Ooh, it's that moment when you start closing in
First you're holding back, then surrendering
It can start a fire, light up the sky
Such a simple thing
Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
And maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

[Verse 3]
'Cause maybe tonight
It could turn into the rest of our lives, oh yeah
Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
To cross that line, put your lips on mine?

[Bridge]
Oh, put your lips on mine, baby
Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic baby
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But no one should be lonely, I shouldn't be lonely
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na (Hey, hey)
Na-na-na-na-na-na (Mm)
I said I wanna kiss a girl
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na (Oh)
Na-na-na-na-na-na (Whoa, oh)
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Oh, I wanna kiss a girl

[Outro]
Na-na-na-na-na-na
I wanna hold her tight
Na-na-na-na-na-na
I wanna make a little magic
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Out under the moonlight
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Ooh, hey, hey
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Ooh, I wanna kiss her now
