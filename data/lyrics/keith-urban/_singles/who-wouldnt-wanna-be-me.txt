[Verse 1]
I got no money in my pockets
I got a hole in my jeans
I had a job and I lost it
But it won't get to me

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm riding with my baby
And it's a brand new day
We're on the wheels of an angel
Flying away

[Chorus]
And the sun is shining
This road keeps winding
Through the prettiest country
From Georgia to Tennessee
And I got the one I love beside me
My troubles behind me
I'm alive and I'm free
Who wouldn't wanna be me

[Verse 3]
Now she's strumming on my six-string
Across her pretty knees
She's stomping out a rhythm
And singing to me the sweetest song

[Chorus]
And the sun is shining
And this road keeps winding
Through the prettiest country
From Georgia to Tennessee
And I got the one I love beside me
My troubles behind me
I'm alive and I'm free
Who wouldn't wanna be me

[Chorus]
And the sun is shining
This road keeps winding
Through the prettiest country
From Georgia to Tennessee
And I got the one I love beside me
My troubles behind me
I'm alive and I'm free
Who wouldn't wanna be me

[Alt. Verse 1]
I got no money in my pockets
I got a hole in my jeans

[Alt. Verse 2]
We're on the wheels of an angel
And I'm free

[Alt. Verse 3 / Outro]
She's strumming on my six-string
It's across her pretty knees
She's stomping out a rhythm
And singin' to me
Oh, oh ohh!
