There's a room in my father's house
Full of old heirlooms
Grandma's Bible, Grandpa's trunk
To a total stranger no more than junk
The closest ties I ever knew
Until I met you

There's a barn on my father's farm
Built with hardwood beams
Sewn by hand to stand the test of time
Cedar dowel pins in Southern pine
The closest thing to strength I knew
Until I met you

Now the stars don't shine the same
Everything's in a state of change
Twilight I never knew
Until I met you

There's a part of my father's heart
That belongs to only one
He told me so a long time ago
Fall in love, then you'll know
The closest thing to God I knew
Until I met you

Now the stars don't shine the same
Everything's in a state of change
Twilight I never knew
Until I met you
Until I met you
Until I met you
