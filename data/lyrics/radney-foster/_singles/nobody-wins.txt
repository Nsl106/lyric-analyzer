[Verse 1]
You said this ain't over yet
I said things that I'll regret
Won't be easy to forget
Scars take time to heal

[Pre-Chorus]
Before another bitter word gets used
I was hoping we could call a truce

[Chorus]
'Cause nobody wins, we both lose
Hearts get broken and love gets bruised
When we light that same
Old fuse again and again
Nobody wins, slamming doors
We both lost this fight before
And I won't play this game no more
'Cause nobody wins

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Darling, we got too much pride
It don't matter who's wrong or right
Honey, love ain't black and white
It's the way I feel 'bout you

[Pre-Chorus]
All I want to do is hold you tight
I can't take another angry night

[Chorus]
When nobody wins, we both lose
Hearts get broken and love gets bruised
When we light that same
Old fuse again and again
Nobody wins, slamming doors
We both lost this fight before
And I won't play this game no more
'Cause nobody wins

[Bridge]
I know something's bound to break if we don't bend
Baby, what's it gonna take?

[Chorus]
Nobody wins, we both lose
Hearts get broken and love gets bruised
When we light that same
Old fuse again and again
Nobody wins, slamming doors
We both lost this fight before
And I won't play this game no more
'Cause nobody wins

[Tag]
Nobody wins (Nobody wins)
Nobody wins (Nobody wins)
Nobody wins (Nobody wins)...
