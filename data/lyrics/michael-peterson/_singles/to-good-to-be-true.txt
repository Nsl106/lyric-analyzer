[Verse 1]
You were all she ever wanted
That was once upon a time
She was all you ever needed
That's what makes it such a crime
How you took her heart for granted
How you threw her love away
Now you still don't understand it
If you did, you'd never say

[Chorus]
It was too good to be true
What did you expect a girl
As good as her to do, what do you
Think would make that woman go
Find somebody new?
She's not too good to be true
She's just too good to be true to you

[Verse 2]
Just because she never said so
Doesn't mean she didn't see
Every time you stole an apple
Off somebody else's tree
Late last night that lipstick letter
She left on the bedroom door
Said, you don't get it
And you ain't gonna get it anymore!

[Chorus]
It was too good to be true
What did you expect a girl
As good as her to do, what do you
Think would make that woman go
Find somebody new?
She's not too good to be true
She's just too good to be true to you

[Chorus]
She's not too good to be true
What did you expect a girl
As good as her to do, what do you
Think would make that woman go
Find somebody new?
She's not too good to be true
She's just too good to be true to you

[Chorus]
(Here we go!) too good to be true
What did you expect a girl
As good as her to do, what do you
Think would make that woman go
Find somebody new?
She's not too good to be true
She's just too good to be true to you

[Outro]
Oh, just too good to be true to you
