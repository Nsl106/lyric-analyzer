With time my face has wrinkled
But my blue eyes still sparkle
With the love I felt for you the day we met
And to me you're just as lovely
As the first time I saw you
Times have changed but our hearts haven't yet
I'm still the same ol' me
Loving the same sweet you
Time, hasn't withered our hearts
And when our days are through
I'll still be loving you
Even death can't keep us apart
And these hands that once were steady
Have now begun to tremble
But when they touch you
The same old feelings there
But your smile is still as special
As it was the day we married
Years haven't changed the love we share
I'm still the same ol' me
Loving the same sweet you
Time, hasn't withered our hearts
And when our days are through
I'll still be loving you
Even death can't keep us apart
I'm still the same ol' me
Loving the same sweet you
