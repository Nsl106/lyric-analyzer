[Verse 1]
I've had good luck and bad luck
And no luck, it's true
But I always get lucky with you
I've been turned on and turned down
When the bars close at two
But I always get lucky with you
I keep strikes against me
Most all of the time
And when it's down to just a phone call
I'm minus a dime
There's been good days and bad days
But when the day is through
Hun, I've always got lucky with you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I've keep two strikes against me
Most all of the time
And when it's down to just a phone call
I'm minus a dime
There's been good days, and bad days
But when the day is through
I always get lucky with you

[Outro]
Oh, I always get lucky with you
I always get lucky with you
