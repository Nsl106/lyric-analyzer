[Verse 1]
I stopped off at the Quicksack
For some beer and cigarettes
The old man took my money
As he stared at my Corvette
He said, "I had one just like her, son
In 1963
'Til the man down at the bank
Took her from me"

[Chorus]
Oh, she was hotter than a two dollar pistol
She was the fastest thing around
Long and lean, every young man's dream
She turned every head in town
She was built, and fun to handle, son
I'm glad that you dropped in
She reminds me of the one I loved back then

[Verse 2]
Then I handed him my keys and said
"Here, take her for a spin"
The old man scratched his head
And then he looked at me and grinned
He said, "Son, you just don't understand
It ain't the car I want
It's the brunette in your 'Vette
That turns me on"

[Chorus]
I had one that was
Hotter than a two dollar pistol
She was the fastest thing around
Long and lean, every young man's dream
She turned every head in town
She was built, and fun to handle, son
I'm glad that you dropped in
She reminds me of the one I loved back then

[Chorus/Outro]
Lord, she was hotter than a two dollar pistol
She was the fastest thing around
Long and lean, every young man's dream
She turned every head in town
She was built, and fun to handle, son
I'm glad that you dropped in
She reminds me of the one I loved back then
She reminds me of the one I loved back then
