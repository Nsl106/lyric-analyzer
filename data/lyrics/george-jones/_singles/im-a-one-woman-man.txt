[Verse 1]
If you told me that you loved me, I would feel so proud
If you'd let me hold you, honey, I'd holler out loud
I'll never love another, even if I can
Well, come to me, baby, I'm a one-woman man

[Chorus]
Won't you let me, baby, just a-kind of hang around?
I'll always love you, honey, and I'll never let you down
I'll never love another, even if I can
Well, come to me, baby, I'm a one-woman man

[Verse 2]
I'd climb the highest mountain if it reached up to the sky
To prove that I love you, I would jump off and fly
I'd even swim the ocean from shore to shore
To prove that I love you just a little bit more

[Chorus]
Won't you let me, baby, just a-kind of hang around?
I'll always love you, honey, and I'll never let you down
I'll never love another, even if I can
Well, come to me, baby, I'm a one-woman man

[Verse 1]
If you told me that you loved me, I would feel so proud
If you'd let me hold you, honey, I'd holler out loud
I'll never love another, even if I can
Well, come to me, baby, I'm a one-woman man

[Chorus]
Won't you let me, baby, just a-kind of hang around?
I'll always love you, honey, and I'll never let you down
I'll never love another, even if I can
Well, come to me, baby, I'm a one-woman man

[Outro]
Come to me, baby, I'm a one-woman man
