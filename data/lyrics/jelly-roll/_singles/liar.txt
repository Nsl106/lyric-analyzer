[Verse 1]
I, I let you drive around my mind
I can't count the times you made me feel like I'm nothin'
Played me like a fool, like a fool

[Pre-Chorus]
Saying, "Drink another whiskey
Pop another pill
Money makes you happy
Heaven isn't real
You won't find nobody to love
Because your heart's too broke"
Now I know

[Chorus]
You ain't nothin' but a liar
Yeah, I walk right out the fire
Yeah, you try to keep me down
Try to put me underground
But I'm only going higher
I can hear you in my head
In my bed when I'm dreaming
You try to be my friend
But you're blowing smoke
Oh, and now, I ain't scared of
Tellin' you where you can go
'Cause I know
You're nothing but a liar

[Verse 2]
You burned me one too many times
Like a devil in disguise, hiding your true colors
Just leave me alone
Keep leading me on

[Pre-Chorus]
Saying, "Drink another whiskey
Pop another pill
Money makes you happy
Heaven isn't real
You won't find nobody to love
Because your heart's too broke"
Now I know

[Chorus]
You ain't nothin' but a liar
Yeah, I walk right out the fire
Yeah, you try to keep me down
Try to put me underground
But I'm only going higher
I can hear you in my head
In my bed when I'm dreaming
You try to be my friend
But you're blowing smoke
Oh, and now, I ain't scared of
Tellin' you where you can go
'Cause I know
You're nothing but a liar

[Bridge]
If I was doin' what you do
Then you would swear I poisoned you

[Chorus]
You're nothing but a liar (Liar)
Yeah, I walk right out the fire (Fire)
Yeah, you try to keep me down
Try to put me underground
But I'm only going higher
I can hear you in my head
In my bed when I'm dreaming
You try to be my friend
But you're blowing smoke
Oh, and now, I ain't scared of
Tellin' you where you can go
'Cause I know
You're nothing but a liar
