[Verse 1]
Dear Lord, can you help me? I've fallen out of grace
I'm crawlin' back to Heaven from this hell on earth I made
My blood has gotten heavy, there's metal in my veins
It's runnin' like the river, filled with all of my mistakes

[Pre-Chorus]
On my knees, I'm lookin' up
I need a different kind of drug

[Chorus]
I'm wide awake and I'm dreaming
Wonderin' where and when I fell apart
Oh, I fell apart
I had enough of my demons
Angels only meet you where you are
And I'm in the dark
'Least for now, Lord, I ain't losin' hope
That somehow you can make a heart of gold
From this heart of stone (Oh)
This heart of stone, oh

[Verse 2]
Dear Lord, can you hear me? I'm shackled in these chains
I'm haunted by the lies of every time I said I'd change
I'm slippin' through the shadows, it's weighing on my soul
The lights are shinin' on me, but there ain't nobody home

[Pre-Chorus]
On my knees, I'm lookin' up
I need a different kind of drug

[Chorus]
I'm wide awake and I'm dreamin'
Wonderin' where and when I fell apart
Oh, I fell apart
I had enough of my demons
Angels only meet you where you are
And I'm in the dark
'Least for now, Lord, I ain't losin' hope
That somehow you can make a heart of gold
From this heart of stone, this heart of stone
This heart of stone

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm wide awake and I'm dreamin'
Wonderin' where and when I fell apart
Oh, I fell apart
I had enough of my demons (Ooh)
But angels only meet you where you are
And I'm in the dark (Oh)
At least for now, Lord, I ain't losin' hope
That somehow you can make a heart of gold
From this heart of stone
This heart of stone
This heart of stone
'Cause I'm wide awake and I'm dreamin'
