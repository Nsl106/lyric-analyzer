[Verse 1]
I am not okay
I'm barely gettin' by
I'm losin' track of days
And losin' sleep at night
I am not okay
I'm hangin' on the rails
So if I say I'm fine
Just know I learned to hide it well

[Chorus]
I know I can't be the only one
Who's holdin' on for dear life
But God knows, I know
When it's all said and done
I'm not okay
But it's all gonna be alright
It's not okay
But we're all gonna be alright

[Verse 2]
I woke up today
I almost stayed in bed
Had the devil on my back
And voices in my head
Some days, it ain't all bad
Some days, it all gets worse
Some days, I swear I'm better off
Layin' in that dirt

[Chorus]
I know I can't be the only one
Who's holdin' on for dear life
But God knows, I know
When it's all said and done
I'm not okay
But it's all gonna be alright
It's not okay
But wе're all gonna be alright
Gonna be alright
Gonna bе alright

[Bridge]
I know one day
We'll see the other side
The pain'll wash away
In a holy water tide
And we all gonna be alright

[Chorus]
I know I can't be the only one
Who's holdin' on for dear life
But God knows, I know
When it's all said and done
I'm not okay
But it's all gonna be alright
It's not okay
But we're all gonna be alright
I'm not okay
But it's all gonna be alright
