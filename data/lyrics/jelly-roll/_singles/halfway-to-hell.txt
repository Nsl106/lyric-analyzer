[Intro]
To save you, boy, He gave his only begotten Son...
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm a county jail revival, I'm a bottle and a Bible
I'm a rolling stone disciple with a cross across my face
I'm a trailer park tornado, jagged edges on my halo
Hope the chariot gon' swing low and carry me away

[Pre-Chorus]
This little light of mine damn near burned me alive
Lord knows that Mama tried and I don't know if I'm

[Chorus]
Halfway to Heaven or halfway to Hell
My angels and demons at war with myself
One foot in the fire and I still can't tell
Am I halfway to Heaven
Halfway to Heaven or Hell?

[Verse 2]
I'm a dive bar Sunday sеrmon, holy water with my bourbon
Standin' on a bridge I'm burning' with a can of gasoline
Am I worth savin' if I'm always fadin'?
It feels likе I'm caught in-between

[Chorus]
Halfway to Heaven or halfway to Hell
My angels and demons at war with myself
One foot in the fire and I still can't tell
Am I halfway to Heaven
Halfway to Heaven or Hell?

[Post-Chorus]
This little light of mine damn near burned me alive
Lord knows that Mama tried and I don't know if I'm

[Chorus]
Halfway to Heaven or halfway to Hell
My angels and demons at war with myself
Halfway to Heaven or halfway to Hell
My angels and demons at war with myself
One foot in the fire and I still can't tell
Am I halfway to Heaven
Halfway to Heaven or Hell?

[Outro]
Halfway to Heaven or Hell

Be lost to the fiery lakes of Hell
Because once you believe, you have crossed over from death to life
So what are you waiting for? What will you do?
We are told simply to repent to be baptized
