[Verse 1]
It was a picture perfect wedding
We had the whole world at our feet
Everyone thought we were
Heading down a lovers easy street
We'd have a house out in the country
A picket fence, the whole nine yards
They said our love would last forever
It was written in the stars

[Chorus]
Wrong
I should have known it all along
When the future looks too bright
Can't be anything but right
Wrong

[Verse 2]
I was all but devastated
When she told me we were through
In a while the heartache faded
And I found somebody new
I swore that this time would be different
I had it all figured out
I wouldn't make the same mistakes
I knew what love was all about

[Chorus][x2]
