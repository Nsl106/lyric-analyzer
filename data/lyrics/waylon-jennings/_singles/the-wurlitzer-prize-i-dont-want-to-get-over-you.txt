I'm not here to forget you I'm here to recall the things we used to say and do
I don't wanna get over you I don't wanna get over you
I haunt the same places we used to go alone at a table for two
I don't wanna get over you I don't wanna get over you
They ought to give me the wurlitzer prize for all the silver I let slide
Down the slot playin' those songs sung blue
They help me remember you I don't want to get over you
A fresh roll of quarters same old song missing you through and through
I don't wanna get over you I don't wanna get over you
They ought to give me
I don't wanna get over you I don't wanna get over you
