[Verse 1]
I've held it all inward, God knows I've tried
But it's an awful awakenin' in a country boy's life
To look in the mirror in total surprise
At the hair on my shoulders and the age in my eyes

[Chorus]
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife

[Verse 2]
It's a measure of people who don't understand
The pleasures of life in a hillbilly band
I got my first guitar when I was fourteen
Now I'm over thirty, still wearing jeans

[Chorus]
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife
