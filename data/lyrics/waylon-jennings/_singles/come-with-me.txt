[Verse 1]
If you're in a valley, with a troubled mind
I'm a mountain, come on and climb
Because you look so good, to be so down
It won't take much girl, to turn it all around

[Chorus]
Come with me, come with me
The feeling's free, just come with me
We'll get on a cloud, babe, and ride it high
Say "Hello sun", as we sail by

[Verse 2]
I'll take you where you've never been before
Once we're there, you'll cry for more
If it's dark in your world, come walk in mine
My love's a light babe, it's on all the time

[Chorus]
Come with me, come with me
The feeling's free, just come with me
We'll get on a cloud, girl, and ride it high
Say "Hello sun", as we sail by

[Chorus]
Won't you come with me, come with me
The feeling's free, just come with me
We'll get on a cloud, babe, and ride it high
Say "Hello sun", as we sail by
