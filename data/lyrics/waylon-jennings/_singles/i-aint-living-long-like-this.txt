[Verse 1]
I looked for trouble and I found it, son
Straight down the barrel of a lawman's gun
I tried to run but I don't think I can
"You make one move and you're a dead man, friend"
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?

[Verse 2]
He slipped the handcuffs on behind my back
Then left me reeling on a steel rail rack
They got 'em all in the jailhouse, baby
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?

[Verse 3]
Grew up in Houston off of Wayside Drive
Son of a carhop at some all night dive
Dad drove a stock car to an early death
All I remember was a drunk man's breath
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?

[Verse 4]
You know the story how the wheel goes 'round
Don't let them take you to the man downtown
Can't sleep at all in a jailhouse, baby
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?

[Bridge]

[Verse 5]
I live with Angel, she's a roadhouse queen
Makes Texas Ruby look like Sandra Dee
I want to love her but I don't know how
I'm at the bottom of the jailhouse now
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?

[Verse 6]
You know the story about the jailhouse rock
Don't want to do it, but just don't get caught
They got 'em all in the jailhouse, baby
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?
