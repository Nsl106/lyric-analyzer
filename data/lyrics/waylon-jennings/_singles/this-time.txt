[Verse]
This time if you want me to come back it's up to you
But remember I won't allow the things you used to do
You're gonna have to toe the mark and walk the line
This time will be the last time
This time if I should feel unwanted I won't stay
Each tomorrow will depend on the love you give today
It's all up to you but keep in mind
This time will be the last time

[Chorus][x2]
If this time should be anything like the other times
This time will be the last time
