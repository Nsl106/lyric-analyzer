[Verse 1]
A long time forgotten our dreams had just fell by the way
And the good life he promised ain't what she's livin' today
But she never complains of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord
She just talks about the good times they've had and all the good times to come

[Chorus]
She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter they'll pass through this world, hand in hand
A good hearted woman, lovin' her good timin' man

[Verse 2]
He likes the night life, bright lights and good timin' friends
When the party's all over she'll welcome him back home again
Lord knows she don't understand him but she does the best that she can
'Cause she's a good hearted woman, she loves her good timin' man

[Chorus]
She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter they'll pass through this world, hand in hand
A good hearted woman, lovin' her good timin' man
She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves me in spite of my ways that she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter they'll pass through this world, hand in hand
A good hearted woman, lovin' her good timin' man
