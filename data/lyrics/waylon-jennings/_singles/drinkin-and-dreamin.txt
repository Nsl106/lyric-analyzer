[Verse 1:]
Everybody's lookin' for some way in
I'm lookin' for some way out
I've been wastin' my time standin' in line
If this is what it's all about
All I got is a job that I don't like
And a woman that don't understand
So tonight at the bar
I'll get in my car
And take off for the promised land

[Chorus:]
Drinkin' and dreamin'
Knowin' damn well I can't go
I'll never see Texas, L.A., or Old Mexico
But here at this table, I'm able to leave it behind
Drink 'til I'm dreamin', a thousand miles out of my mind

[Verse 2:]
This suit and this tie, is just a disguise
This ain't really me
Some people are born, to be tied down
Some people are born to be free
When I look down the road she don't know
How it gets under my skin
She's got my body but my heart and soul
Are out there ridin' the wind

[Chorus][x2]
