You were always there to talk to
And I was always hanging around
You were always there to pick me up
After love let me down

I never would have made it without you
I almost made it too late to see
All the time I was leaning on you
You were leaning on me

Friends
That's what we've been
Is friends
Through thick and thin
We've been friends and our love begins
And who makes better lovers than friends

Friends should always be something special
You never know where friendship will lead
We aere sailing high on the sea of love
And forever will be

Friends
That's what we've been
Is friends
Through thick and thin
We've been friends and our love begins
And who makes better lovers than friends

Friends
That's what we've been
Is friends
Through thick and thin
We've been friends and our love begins
And who makes better lovers than friends
