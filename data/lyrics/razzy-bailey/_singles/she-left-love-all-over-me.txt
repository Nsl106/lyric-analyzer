Her lips were soft
Her lips were warm
Her kiss burns deep inside of me
Her touch was gentle as the finest satin
Lord, I still feel her touching me

I still hear the rhythm that our hearts beat
When we were so near
And I still feel her warm breath
The way it touched me when she was here

She left love all over me
From my head down to my feet
I've been sleeping with her dream
She left love all over me

My soul is crying
To have her body lying
So close to me once again
My body's aching
Lord, how it's shaking
When I think of her loving me again

And I can't think of nothing else
Except the way I felt at the time
And I still smell the perfume
On the memory that the lady left behind

She left love all over me
From my head down to my feet
I've been sleepin' with her dream
She left love all over me

She left love all over me
From my head down to my feet
And I've been sleeping with her dream
She left love all over me

She left love all over me.....
