Might as well admit it
Your love has got the best of me
As long as I'm in it
You might as well take the rest of me

You can take one night
And turn it into a lifetime
But when the morning comes
I'll be right back where I started from

I keep coming back
Even though I'm asking for a lonely
My heart won't listen
I keep coming back even though
I know it's more than I can take
I'm standing at your door
'Cause baby, I keep coming back for more

Baby, I'm not lying
There ain't a thing in this world
I would not do for you
Maybe if I keep trying, darling
Then I can just show you
How much I can do for you crave for you

You can take one night
And turn it into a lifetime
But when the morning comes
I'll be right back where I started from

I keep coming back
Even though I'm asking for a lonely
My heart won't listen
I keep coming back even though
I know it's more than I can take
I'm standing at your door
'Cause baby, I keep coming back for more

I keep coming back
Even though I'm asking for a lonely
My heart won't listen
I keep coming back even though
I know it's more than I can take
I'm standing at your door
'Cause baby, I keep coming back for more
