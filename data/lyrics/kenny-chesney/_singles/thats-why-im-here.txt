[Verse 1]
Well I ain't had nothin' to drink
I knew that's probably what you'd think
If I'd drop by this time of night
Remember way back when
I promised you I'd drop in
At one of those meetings down at the "Y"

[Verse 2]
They started talking' about steps you take
Mistakes you make, the hearts you break
And the price you pay, I almost walked away
You could hear a pin drop
When this old man stood up
And said, "I'm gonna say it again
Like I do every week
For those who don't know me"

[Chorus]
It's the simple things in life
Like the kids at home and a loving wife
That you miss the most, when you lose control
And everything you love starts to disappear
The Devil takes your hand and says no fear
Have another shot, just one more beer
Yeah I've been there
That's why I'm here

[Verse 3]
This old boy stood up in the aisle
Said he'd been living' a life of denial
Then he cried, as he talked about wasted years
I couldn't believe what I heard
It was my life word for word
And all of the sudden, it was clear

[Chorus]
It's the simple things in life
Like the kids at home and a loving' wife
That you miss the most, when you lose control
And everything you love starts to disappear
The Devil takes your hand and says no fear
Have another shot, just one more beer
Yeah I've been there
That's why I'm here

[Bridge]
I know for us it may be too late
But it would mean the world to me
If you were there when I stand to say

[Chorus]
It's the simple things in life
Like the kids at home and a loving' wife
That you miss the most, when you lose control
And everything you love starts to disappear
The Devil takes your hand and says no fear
Have another shot, just one more beer
Yeah I've been there
That's why I'm here

[Outro]
OOH, I've been there
That's why I'm here
