[Verse 1]
Downtown looks like it's New Year's Eve
You find some bar you can halfway breathe
TouchTunes some old deep-cut Cheap Trick
Got your girl singin' every word of it
So you bring a couple shots of chilled Patron
To the prettiest thing that you ever hit on
And somehow she ain't got a boyfriend
So you make her laugh all night and then

[Chorus]
Take her home, fall in love
Thank the good Lord up above
That He sent one down into your arms
And put a chain around your raised-hell heart
You try to play it cool walkin' through the door
But you're smilin' like a fool 'cause you can't wait for
Them down-thе-road memories you're bound to makе
And you will one day take her home

[Verse 2]
Got a stuffed truck sittin' in the driveway
In the back there's a black and a pink suitcase
She can't stop sayin' she's freakin' out
You say, "Baby, you ain't got nothin' to worry about"
Then you hold her hand, kiss her one time
And throw it in drive

[Chorus]
And take her home, and fall in love
Thank the good Lord up above
That He sent one down into your arms
And put a chain around your raised-hell heart
You try to play it cool walkin' through the door
But you're smilin' like a fool 'cause you can't wait for
Them down-the-road memories you're bound to make
And you will one day take her home

[Post-Chorus]
Take her home

[Bridge]
Sometimes God draws life like a dream
Paints you a seven-pound five-ounce scene
In a car seat creepin' down the interstate
Two young lovers that are scared to death but still can't wait

[Chorus]
To take her home, fall in love
Thank the good Lord up above
That He sent one down into your arms
And put a chain around your raised-hell heart
You try to play it cool walkin' through the door
But you're smilin' like a fool 'cause you can't wait for
Them down-the-road memories you're bound to make
And you will one day take her home

[Outro]
(Take her home, take her home, take her home)
Take her home
(Take her home, take her home, take her home)
