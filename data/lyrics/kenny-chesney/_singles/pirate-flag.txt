[Verse 1]
Well, I come from a little bitty, homegrown small town
Smoky Mountains, nice place to hang around
Moonshine, that's where they make it
Put it in a jug, makes you wanna get naked
But I jumped on a Greyhound bus one night
And took it all the way to the end of the line
Stepped out in the sun, when my feet hit the sand
What a long, strange trip

[Chorus]
I spent my whole life running around (Running around)
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well, I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world
A pirate flag and an island girl

[Verse 2]
Well, my friends back home think I've gone and lost my mind
Take a sip of rum and you really would know why
Jolly Roger flying on the picnic table
Blender in the kitchen, willing and able
Don't know what makes you say, "What the hell?"
But when the salt air catches a hold of that sail
Something 'bout it makes her just want to dance
And she loves to dance

[Chorus]
I spent my whole life running around (Running around)
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well, I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world
A pirate flag and an island girl

[Post-Chorus]
A pirate flag and an island girl (Island girl)

[Bridge]
Well, I remember back home 'neath the big old moon
Tucked back in the woods, yeah, life was good
But here we are in a local bar
And drinking shooting stars

[Chorus]
I might spend my whole life running around (Running around)
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well, I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world
A pirate flag and an island girl

[Post-Chorus]
A pirate flag and an island girl
A pirate flag and an island girl

[Outro]
A pirate flag and an island girl
A pirate flag and an island girl
