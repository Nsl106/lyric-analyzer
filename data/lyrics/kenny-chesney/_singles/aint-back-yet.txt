[Verse 1]
I heard a song about a rambling man
Bought a guitar and I started a band
I got a gig at the local Am Vet
I was gone and I ain't back yet

69 bored, out and jacked up
A quarter mile that was all it was
I burned the cool off of that Corvette
And I was gone and I ain't back yet

[Chorus]
Looking back at the moments, black and white
I wouldn't change a thing that changed my life
For the worse, for the better
Man, I was gone, gone forever

[Verse 2]
She was a cut offs pepper sauce queen
Man, we were matches and gasoline
First taste of love never will forget
I was gone and I ain't back yet
I was gone, gone and I ain't back yet

[Chorus]
Looking back at the moments, black white
I wouldn't change a thing that changed my life
For the worse, for the better
Man, I was gone, gone forever
The laughs, the smiles, the trials, the tears
It's hard to hate what got me here
What got me here

[Verse 3]
She was a straight out of Hollywood smile
We missed it all by a country mile
Went out one night for some cigarettes
And I was gone and I ain't back yet

[Hook]
I was gone, gone and I ain't back yet
I was gone and I ain't back, ain't back, ain't back
And I was gone, and I ain't back yet
I was gone, and I ain't back yet
I was gone, and I ain't back yet
