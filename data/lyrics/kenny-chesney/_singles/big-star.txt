[Verse 1]
She was aware of her insecurities as she took the stage
She was convinced if she got up there that she'd be discovered someday

[Pre-Chorus]
So she belted it
She hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh, she melted them
As she brought them to their feet

[Chorus]
She was a big star at Banana Joe's bar where she sang karaoke every night
She said, "If you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight"
She was a big star

[Verse 2]
She made the local cable shows where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends the groupies were crawling all over the place

[Pre-Chorus]
And she signed autographs
Like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath
That small-time town was hers

[Chorus]
She was a big star at Banana Joe's bar where she sang karaoke every night
She said, "If you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight"
She was a big star

[Bridge]
She doesn't care anymore that her high school girlfriends cut her down
The only thought she entertains is where they are
And where she is now

[Verse 3]
Her old neighbors swear they're certain she slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you're going 'less you got something they ain't got

[Pre-Chorus]
So she sings tonight
To twenty-thousand plus
And the young girls scream out loud
"Man, that could be us"

[Chorus]
She's a big star as she eats caviar just before she performs every night
She says, "If you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight"
She's a big star
She's a big star
