[Verse 1]
Now baby don't worry if he troubles your mind
Cause it'll all wash away girl, in the river of time
If you need a shoulder, well I'll be around
I'll be your rock to hold onto, 'til that river goes down

[Chorus]
Cause it's hell and high water that you're going through
Come hell or high water I'll be here waiting for you

[Verse 2]
I can't keep you from crying and I can't stop your pain
Lord the brightest of sunshine never could stop the rain
But you know that I'll be there, just like that old sun
I'm gonna be your good morning when your crying's all done

[Chorus]
It's hell and high water that you're going through
Come hell or high water I'll be here waiting for you

[Chorus]
It's hell and high water that you're going through
Come hell or high water I'll be here waiting for you
