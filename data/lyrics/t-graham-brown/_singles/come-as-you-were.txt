[Verse 1]
I'm giving a party tonight
With Champagne and pink party lights
Hope you'll attend if you're free
Come as you were before you stopped loving me

[Verse 2]
The party is BYOL
So bring your own love you once felt
Don't bother to RSVP
Just come as you were before you stopped loving me

[Verse 3]
If you're sorry that you've hurt me
You've seen the light
Do me a party favor girl
And love me tonight

[Verse 4]
Cause my party could be so much fun
If only you'd just say you'd come
If here's where you want to be
Just come as you were before you stopped loving me

[Tag]
If here's where you long to be
Just come as you were before you stopped loving me
Come as you were
Before you stopped loving me
