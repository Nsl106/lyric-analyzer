[Verse 1: T. Graham Brown]
I'm glad we took this holiday, at least we've got a week or two to stay
Just get away, away from all the hurrying
Forget about the worry in our lives
Just you and I

[Chorus: T. Graham Brown]
Now we've come back to try to find
Part of us we left behind
Can we save our love, make it the way it was before
Here at the last resort

[Verse 2: T. Graham Brown]
Remember when we first came here
It doesn't seem like that many years ago, we were so close
Time can erase those memories, time has been our worst enemy
We both know our love's dying slow

[Chorus: T. Graham Brown]
Now we've come back to try to find
That part of us we left behind
Can we save our love, make it the way it was before
Here at the last resort

[Bridge: T. Graham Brown]
So this is where it all began
Let's don't let this be where it ends

[Chorus: T. Graham Brown]
'Cause we've come back to try to find
Part of us we left behind
We can save our love, make it the way it was before
Here at the last resort

[Outro: T. Graham Brown]
At the last resort
This is our last resort
