[Verse 1]
I tried to be just what you wanted
Oh but I was always wishing on the moon
Things were always going wrong and oh it took so long
And you just left me way too soon

[Chorus]
If you could only see me now
Now I've turned my life around completely
If I could bring you back somehow
I know that I could make you proud to love me
Oh I think you'd be surprised I'd be something in your eyes
If you could only see me now

[Verse 2]
Some crazy dream was always waiting
Down some road I had to follow to the end
I meant to come back home, time kept rolling on
I'd love to have that chance again

[Chorus]
If you could only see me now
Now I've turned my life around completely
If I could bring you back somehow
I know that I could make you proud to love me
I think you'd be surprised I'd be something in your eyes
If you could only see me now

[Tag]
I think you'd be surprised I'd be something in your eyes
If you could only see me now
