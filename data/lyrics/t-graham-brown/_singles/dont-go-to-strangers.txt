[Verse 1]
All over town the bars are closing down
One by one the lights grow dim
I've been sitting here drinking
And thinking about you out somewhere with him

[Verse 2]
He's just one of the many men you've tried
Still you tell me you ain't satisfied
If you want love
Don't go to strangers

[Verse 3]
I've seen you out on the prowl like this
Night after night after night
Looking for love but you settle for a kiss
And unknown arms to hold you tight

[Verse 4]
But it seems no matter what you do
It never turns out like you want it to
If you want love, real true love
If you want love, don't go to strangers

[Verse 5]
Every night I have this dream
You're gonna wake up and understand
That all the love you've been looking for
Is right here in your hand, oh my love

[Verse 6]
How many nights you gonna lay down your sweet love
To someone you don't really want
Can't you see you'd be happy with me
I'd be much more than your confidant

[Verse 7]
All's I'm the one you tell your troubles to
You've told me everything but "I love you"
Oh my love, true love
If you want some love, don't go to strangers
