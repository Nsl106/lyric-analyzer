[Verse 1]
Darlene, sit down I need to talk to you
Then you do what you wanna do
Just hear me through

[Verse 2]
Darlene, you don't need no other guys
When you gonna realize
How much I love you

[Chorus]
Darlene, go in there and pack up all your dreams
I'll have all I'll ever need
If you'll go with me
Darlene, honey I can give you everything
And I want you for my darling, Darlene

[Verse 3]
Darlene, we're both tired of just hanging around
Tired of dreaming in this sleepy town
The rest is history

[Chorus]
Darlene, go in there and pack up all your dreams
Cause I'll have all I'll ever need
If you'll go with me
Darlene, sugar I can give you everything
And I want you for my darling, Darlene

[Tag]
So I want you for my darling, Darlene
Well I need you for my darling, Darlene
