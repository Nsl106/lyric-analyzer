It's a cheating, situation
A stealing, invitation
To take what's not really ours
To make it through the midnight hours
It's a cheating, situation
Just a cheap imitation
Doing what we have, to do
When there's no love at home

Verse 1:
There's no use in pretending
There'll be a happy ending
Where our love's concerned
Sweetheart, we both know
We'll take love where we find it
It's all we've got, for we know they're not
Gonna let us go
It's a cheating situation
When there's no love at home
