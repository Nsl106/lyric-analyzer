[Chorus]
When you say love
You're telling everyone your moment's come
And you've found what you've been a-looking for
When you say love
You've said the only word that tells the world
You never will be lonely anymore

[Verse 1]
You've got a pretty rainbow all your own
And at last you've found your pot of gold
You're completely satisfied
Feeling of contentment fills your soul

[Chorus]
When you say love
It means you've found your special one
And that you care enough to give your very best
Whеn you say love
There's not anothеr word that says so much
But that four-letter word means happiness

[Verse 2]
Your heart has given wings to touch the sky
Much higher than the eagle dares to fly
If you took everything you've heard and tried to make a magic word
You'll find you've said it all when you say love

[Chorus]
When you say love
It means you've found your special one
And that you care enough to give your very best
When you say love
There's not another word that says so much
But that four-letter word means happiness

[Verse 3]
Your heart has given wings to touch the sky
Much higher than the eagle dares to fly
If you took everything you've heard and tried to make a magic word
You'll find you've said it all when you say love

[Outro]
You'll find you've said it all when you say love
