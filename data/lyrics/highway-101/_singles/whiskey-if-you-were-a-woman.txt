[Verse 1]
He's told me a million times he's sorry
I always take him back, though soon I know
He'll spend the night with you and let me cryin'
You don't love him, but you won't let him go

[Chorus]
Oh whiskey, if you were a woman
I'd fight you and I'd win, Lord knows I would
Oh whiskey, if you were a woman
I'd drive you from his tangled mind for good

[Verse 2]
No matter what you do, I'll do it better
You'll never be the woman I could be
But you don't have a heart or any feelings
So I can't even ask for sympathy

[Chorus]
Oh whiskey, if you were a woman
I'd fight you and I'd win, Lord knows I would
Oh whiskey, if you were a woman
I'd drive you from his tangled mind for good

[Tag]
Oh whiskey, if you were a woman
I'd drive you from his tangled mind for good
