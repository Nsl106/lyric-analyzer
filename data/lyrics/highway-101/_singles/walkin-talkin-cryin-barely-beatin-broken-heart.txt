[Verse 1]
If you see me in some corner looking like all hope is gone
If you see me sit for hours and you wonder what is wrong
Well it hurts to talk about it but my world just fell apart
I'm a walkin', talkin', cryin', barely beatin' broken heart

[Verse 2]
Did you see the teardrops falling and the tremble in my hands
Then you'll know that there's a story and nobody understands
It's a sad and lonely story but I'll try to make it short
I'm a walkin', talkin', cryin', barely beatin' broken heart

[Chorus]
Should you wonder how I got this way, well listen, listen good
He left me for another, thought he'd be the last who would
So I'm trying to forget him, looking for a place to start
I'm a walkin', talkin', cryin', barely beatin' broken heart

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You may wonder how I got this way, well listen, listen good
He left me for another, thought he'd be the last who would
So I'm trying to forget him, looking for a place to start
I'm a walkin', talkin', cryin', barely beatin' broken heart
