Well I met you in a bar and you looked like a movie star
When we touched, I could feel a spark
I was young and foolish too, my friends warned me about you
But I believed in your honky tonk heart

Chorus:
Our song of love is almost ended
I can feel us driftin' apart
I won't play 2nd fiddle
To the beat of your honky tonk heart

Well we used to feel the same but now one of us has changed
Oh the night life isn't my life anymore
What matters most to me is a home and a family
But you can't find that behind those swingin' doors

Chorus
