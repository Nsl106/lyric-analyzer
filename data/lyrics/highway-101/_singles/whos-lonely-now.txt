You walked out on a good love
And you found somebody new
And now the one that turned your head
Is turning her back on you

Who's lonely now, who's heart is hurting
I've had my share of those blues
Who's lonely now, who's head is reelin'
You're finally feelin' it too
Now you need a little sympathy
You never shoulda walked out on me
Who's lonely now

I feel a whole lot better
I got a new attitude
So you can take my crying towel
And carry it home with you

Who's lonely now, who's heart is hurting
I've had my share of those blues
Who's lonely now, who's head is reelin'
You're finally feelin' it too
Now you need a little sympathy
You never shoulda walked out on me
Who's lonely now

When your rejected, you feel neglected, its true
In your condition, you need attention
And you know I'd like to help, but I'm seeing someone else
Who's lonely now

Now you know I'd like to help, but I'm seeing someone else

Who's lonely now, who's heart is hurting
I've had my share of those blues
Who's lonely now, who's head is reelin'
You're finally feelin' it too
Now you need a little sympathy
You never shoulda walked out on me
Who's lonely now
