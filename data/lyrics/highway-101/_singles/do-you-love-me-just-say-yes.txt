[Verse 1]
If I came by 'round nine tonight
Baby, doubt would it be all right
I've got it, bad boy, I must confess
Tell you now honey would you mind
If I took your hand in mine
Could I hold you; just say yes

[Chorus]
Come on, it's on the tip of your tongue
So easily done, such a small request
Oh babe, you got something to say
Don't keep me waiting, don't make me guess
Oh, do you love me; just say yes

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You don't have to go on and on
'Cuz you know what I really want
And that's your love; no more, no less
There's only one thing I need to hear
When you whisper in my ear
And that's one word; just say yes

[Chorus]
Come on, it's on the tip of your tongue
So easily done, such a small request
Oh babe, you got something to say
Don't keep me waiting, don't make me guess
Oh, do you love me; just say yes
