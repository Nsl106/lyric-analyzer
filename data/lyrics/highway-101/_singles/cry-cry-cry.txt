IT'S JUST A LITTLE CREEK NOW
BUT WHEN THE RAIN COMES DOWN
IT'S GONNA BE A RAGING RIVER
I JUST HEARD MY BABY SAY GOODBYE
HE LEFT ME HERE HOLDING BACK MY TEARS
AND NOW HE'S GONE FOREVER
THE DAM'S GONNA BREAK AND I'M A-GONNA CRY, CRY, CRY

WELL I'M A-GONNA CRY AND I DON'T CARE WHO SEES
I WONDER IF HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DONE TO ME
GONNA LOVE THAT BOY TILL THE DAY I DIE
TILL THE DAY I DO I'M GONNA CRY, CRY, CRY

NOW HE'S GONE THE PAIN'S COMING ON
I CAN FEEL MY WHOLE BODY SHAKING
LOOKY HERE NOW WHAT'S THIS IN MY EYE
ALL I HEAR RINGING IN MY EAR
IS THE SOUND OF MY HEART BREAKING
THE DAM'S GONNA BREAK AND I'M A-GONNA CRY, CRY, CRY

WELL I'M A-GONNA CRY AND I DON'T CARE WHO SEES
I WONDER IF HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DONE TO ME
GONNA LOVE THAT BOY TILL THE DAY I DIE
TILL THE DAY I DO I'M GONNA CRY, CRY, CRY

WELL I'M A-GONNA CRY AND I DON'T CARE WHO SEES
I WONDER IF HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DONE TO ME
GONNA LOVE THAT BOY TILL THE DAY I DIE
TILL THE DAY I DO I'M GONNA CRY, CRY, CRY
