[Verse 1]
Sometimes in the morning, my coffee gets ice cold
And I'll burn up three cigarettes 'fore I have my first smoke
Miss my exit on the way to work every now and then
I always blame it on the traffic when they ask me where I've been

[Verse 2]
And in a crowded elevator, I'll start hummin' that ol' song
And there's no way of knowin' when that urge will come along
I've been stuck in some meeting, looked down at my legal pad
I'd see hearts and flowers and butterflies and I can't help but laugh

[Pre-Chorus]
That's just a dirt road, summer '89
That's just a back seat and some Muscadine wine
That's just auburn hair brushing 'cross my cheek
And those "kiss me" green eyes smilin' back at me

[Chorus]
That's just my mind jumpin' fences once again
But I'll be fine once I get it rowed back in
I know sometimes I may act a little crazy
But that's just Jessie

[Verse 3]
And sometimes in the evening, I hear bare feet in the hall
And I see a slender silhouette dance across the wall
Then I catch the scent of jasmine perfume in the wind
And I know it's her sweet memory coming back again

[Pre-Chorus]
That's just a dirt road, summer '89
That's just a back seat and some Muscadine wine
That's just auburn hair brushing 'cross my cheek
And those "kiss me" green eyes smilin' back at me

[Chorus]
That's just my mind jumpin' fences once again
But I'll be fine once I get it rowed back in
I know sometimes I may act a little crazy
But that's just Jessie

[Post-Chorus]
In a white cotton dress
That's just a wildfire that I ain't put out yet
That's just auburn hair brushing 'cross my cheek
And those "kiss me" green eyes smilin' back at me

[Outro]
That's just my mind jumpin' fences once again
But I'll be fine once I get it rowed back in
I know sometimes I may act a little crazy
But that's just Jessie
