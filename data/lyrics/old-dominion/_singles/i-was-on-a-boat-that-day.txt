[Intro]
A one, two
A one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
I remember it like it was yesterday
'Cause it was
I was letting this sun and the rum just do what it does
I threw my phone in the water
Little push off the dock
She was packing her bags I was poppin' a top

[Chorus]
Is she gone for the summer?
Gone for the night?
Gone for the weekend or the rest of my life?
Was she laughing?
Was she crying as she walked away?
I can't say
I was on a boat that day
The river was rolling
I was getting my float on
She was telling me so long
I was already so long gone
Yeah

[Verse 2]
She could have been halfway to Houston but I didn't care
I was drunk as a skunk eating lunch with a cross eyed bear
You've been there
She was looking for something, better than me
I was looking for nothing, just riding the breeze

[Chorus]
Is she gone for the summer?
Gone for the night?
Gone for the weekend or the rest of my life?
Was she laughing?
Was she crying as she walked away?
I can't say
I was on a boat that day
The river was rolling
I was getting my float on
She was telling me so long
I was already so long gone
Yeah
Hey hey

[Bridge]
I remember it like it was yesterday
'Cause it was
And I still got a buzz

[Chorus]
Is she gone for the summer?
Gone for the night?
Gone for the weekend or the rest of my life?
Was she laughing?
Was she crying as she walked away?
I can't say
I was on a boat that day
The river was rolling
I was getting my float on
She was telling me so long
I was on a boat that day
The river was rolling
I was getting my float on
She was telling me so long
I was on a boat that day

Hey hey hey (Hey hey hey)
I was on a boat that day
Hey hey hey
