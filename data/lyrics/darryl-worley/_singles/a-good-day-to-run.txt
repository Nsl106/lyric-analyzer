[Verse 1]
I'm tired of working every day for a dollar
About to choke on my own blue collar, this ain't gonna last
Misled by the grand illusion
I've come to this conclusion, I can't make a move too fast

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It was written in the sky today
By the morning sun
It sure looks like a good day to run

[Chorus]
Wide open down a two-lane highway
It's about time that some things went my way
Throwing troubles out to the wind
And I'm praying that they never catch up again
I'm gonna say my worrying days are done
And this looks like a good day to run

[Verse 2]
My baby's been working as a cashier
She didn't get a vacation this past year, but now it won't be long
We don't need no destination
Just a tank of gas and a good clear station playing our favorite song

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's some places that we ain't been
Some things that we ain't done
And it sure looks like a good day to run

[Chorus]
Wide open down a two-lane highway
It's about time that some things went my way
Throwing troubles out to the wind
And I'm praying that they never catch up again
I'm gonna say my worrying days are done
And this looks like a good day to run

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm gonna say my worrying days are done
This looks like a good day to run
Good day to run
A good day to run
We got a good, good day
