[Verse 1]
You were raised on an asphalt farm
Ain't never heard a rooster crow
Never walked barefoot by a river
Felt the mud up betweenst your toes
You never rolled in the hay
You never thrown it in four wheel
Climb up on in here, girl
Let me show you how country feels

[Chorus]
Let your hair down, hair down, get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off, get you some of this slow down fast
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how country feels

[Verse 2]
Never watched the sun go down
From the bed of a pickup truck
You ever been so into somebody
You're still lying there when it comes back up
Girl, what do you say? (What do you say?)
We'll cut a path through that cornfield
Park down by the water
Let me show you how country feels

[Chorus]
Let your hair down, hair down, get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off, get you some of this slow down fast
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how country feels

[Post-Chorus]
Let your hair down, get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off (Kick your shoes off)

[Chorus]
Let your hair down, hair down, get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off, get you some of this slow down fast
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how country feels

[Outro]
Country feels
