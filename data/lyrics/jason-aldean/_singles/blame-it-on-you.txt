[Verse 1]
Goin' down like a sunset
Burnin' out like a cigarette
Blowin' through the cash, through the past
Drinking down that memory 'til there's nothin' left

[Pre-Chorus]
I could go on and on
Why you're gone

[Chorus]
I could blame it on the whiskey
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me
Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go
I could blame it on a good high
Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye
Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go

[Post-Chorus]
I could say I never knew
I could drink around the truth
But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?)
Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?)

[Verse 2]
Trying to ride out the midnight
Trying to fight through the daylight
Wonderin' where you're at, and just like that
I'm lookin' back on what I had when you were mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I could go on and on (For a long, long time, yeah)
Why you're gone

[Chorus]
I could blame it on the whiskey
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me
Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go
I could blame it on a good high
Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye
Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go

[Post-Chorus]
I could say I never knew
Yeah, I can drink around the truth
But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?)
Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?)

[Pre-Chorus]
I could go on and on (For a long, long time, yeah)
Why you're gone

[Chorus]
I could blame it on the whiskey
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me
Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go
I could blame it on a good high
Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye
Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go

[Post-Chorus]
I could say I never knew
Yeah, I could drink around the truth (For a long, long time, yeah)
I could say I never knew
Yeah, I can drink around the truth
But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?)
Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?)
