[Verse 1]
I knew the minute that I picked you up
It was gonna be a wild ride
You kissed me like you couldn't get enough
Barely made it out of your drive
Burn a little rubber at the red light
Got a little warning from the blue lights
It's only going nine o'clock but feels more like midnight

[Chorus]
We ain't even turned up the radio
Ain't been two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we gotta whole lot of moonlight left
Already having the time of my lives
And we're just getting started tonight

[Verse 2]
Girl you already got the window down
And you got your seat laid back
I ain't even made it halfway to town
And you're already talking about a six pack
Already got your shoes off
And you talking about slipping off
No we ain't even found your friends saying
You already wanna get lost

[Chorus]
We ain't even turned up the radio
Ain't been two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we gotta whole lot of moonlight left
Already having the time of my lives
And we're just getting started tonight

[Bridge]
Ain't had a drink and I'm tore up
Ain't even had a taste of your love
But girl the crazy thing is
We're just getting warmed up

[Chorus]
We ain't even turned up the radio
Ain't been two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we gotta whole lot of moonlight left
Already having the time of my lives
And we're just getting started tonight
And we're just getting started tonight
