[Intro]
Whatcha got

[Verse 1]
Quit my job, flipped off the boss, took my name off the payroll, screw ya man
Picked up my cell, rang my baby's bell, said I'm three miles from home
I said, "Sugar, won't you put on that sundress I like so much"
Wait out by the road, I'm comin' to pick you up

[Chorus]
(Whoa-oh)
Throw your suitcase in the back
(Whoa-oh)
Done gassed up the Pontiac
(Whoa-oh)
Blastin' out to Johnny Cash
Headin' for the highway
Baby we ain't ever comin' back

[Verse 2]
It's four hundred and sixty-seven miles to the outskirts of Las Vegas
What do you say we go get married by a preacher man who looks like Elvis, yeah, momma
Sugar, don't you worry 'bout tellin' your momma goodbye
We'll send her a souvenir postcard from the wild side

[Chorus]
(Whoa-oh)
Throw your suitcase in the back
(Whoa-oh)
Done gassed up the Pontiac
(Whoa-oh)
Blastin' out to Johnny Cash
Headin' for the highway
Baby we ain't ever comin' back

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
(Whoa-oh)
Throw your suitcase in the back
(Whoa-oh)
Done gassed up the Pontiac
(Whoa-oh)
Blastin' out to Johnny Cash
Headin' for the highway
Baby we ain't ever comin' back, suey

[Outro]
(Whoa-oh)
(Whoa-oh)
(Whoa-oh)
Hear that train a comin', rollin' around the bend
(Whoa-oh)
The Man in Black gonna rock your ass again
(Whoa-oh)
(Whoa-oh)
(Whoa-oh)
Na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na na-na-na
