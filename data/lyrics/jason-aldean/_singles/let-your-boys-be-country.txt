[Verse 1]
Let your boys be country, let 'em keep that red dirt on his boots
Make 'em proud of that middle nowhere he's got down in his roots
Let 'em work in a hayfield sweating for a little summer cash
Raise 'em hard, raise 'em tough, bring 'em up to have their brother's back

[Chorus]
Let 'em ride 'round in trucks, making backroad noise
Let 'em hang out on Friday, getting wild with the boys
Let 'em go to the woods in the cold, painted up camo green
Yeah, let 'em chase, lеt 'em fall for a small-town girl
Let evеrything inside these county lines be his whole world
You want him to grow up to be someone he's damn proud to be
Mamas, let your boys be country

[Verse 2]
Teach 'em "Yes, ma'am" and "No, ma'am" and never turn down a cold beer
Tell 'em there ain't nothing greener than the grass you're standing on right here

[Chorus]
Let 'em ride 'round in trucks, making backroad noise
Let 'em hang out on Friday, getting wild with the boys
Let 'em go to the woods in the cold, painted up camo green
Yeah, let 'em chase, let 'em fall for a small-town girl
Let everything inside these county lines be his whole world
You want him to grow up to be someone he's damn proud to be
Mamas, let your boys be country

[Post-Chorus]
Mamas, let your boys be country

[Chorus]
Yeah, let 'em chase, let 'em fall for a small-town girl
Let everything inside these county lines be his whole world
You want him to grow up to be someone he's damn proud to be
Mamas, let your boys be country
Let 'em ride 'round in trucks, making backroad noise
Let 'em hang out on Friday, getting wild with the boys
Let 'em go to the woods in the cold, painted up camo green
Mamas, let your boys be country

[Outro]
Let your boys be country
