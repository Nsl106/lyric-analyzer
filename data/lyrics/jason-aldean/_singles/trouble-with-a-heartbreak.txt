[Intro]
The trouble with a heartbreak (Heartbreak, heartbreak)

[Verse 1]
Don't let anybody tell ya it's gonna be easy ('Cause it ain't easy, no)
Don't let anyone tell ya they know what it's like
Mmh, when they say, "Get out on this town, meet somebody new"
Get lost in a crowd, all I see is you
Don't let anybody tell ya it's gonna be easy

[Chorus]
And that's the trouble with a heartbreak, it's gonna hang around
Leave you midnight breakin' down, wonderin' how
Long that it's gonna take gettin' over her
It's a can't drown, whiskey down, kinda hurt
Yеah, you can burn them four wheels up that road
But there ain't nowhеre her memory can't go
That's the trouble with a heartbreak
Yeah, that's the trouble with a heartbreak, a heartbreak, yeah
(Heartbreak, heartbreak, heartbreak)

[Verse 2]
Think about where she is, who she's drivin' crazy (Drivin' me crazy)
Can't see a rearview sunset without thinkin' 'bout us
Girl, I still think about us

[Chorus]
And that's the trouble with a heartbreak, it's gonna hang around
Leave you midnight breakin' down, wonderin' how
Long that it's gonna take gettin' over her
It's a can't drown, whiskey down, kinda hurt
Yeah, you can burn them four wheels up that road
But there ain't nowhere her memory can't go
That's the trouble with a heartbreak
Yeah, that's the trouble with a heartbreak, a heartbreak, yeah
Oh, yeah that's the trouble with a heartbreak

[Bridge]
Get out on this town, meet somebody new
(Meet somebody, get out of this town)
Get lost in a crowd, all I see is you

[Chorus]
And that's the trouble with a heartbreak, it's gonna hang around
Leave you midnight breakin' down, wonderin' how
Long that it's gonna take gettin' over her
It's a can't drown, whiskey down, kinda hurt
Yeah, you can burn them four wheels up that road
But there ain't nowhere her memory can't go
That's the trouble with a heartbreak
Yeah, that's the trouble with a heartbreak, a heartbreak, yeah

[Outro]
Heartbreak, heartbreak, oh yeah
That's the trouble with a heartbreak, oh yeah
