[Verse 1]
Hey, whiskey drink
I know it's been a while
I gotta talk to you, gotta catch you up
On the hell I'm in right now
Yeah, whiskey drink
Now, you won't believe
The things I said, the way she left
The way the leavin' all went down

[Pre-Chorus]
It might take all night
To get her off my mind
I need you one more time
Yeah, be a good friend

[Chorus]
Come on, kick in, whiskey drink
I don't wanna think, think, think
About who she's with or where she is
Or how bad I miss her now
Come on, cigarette
Yeah, smoke out that regret
Pour it straight and strong, make her memory gone
Before you let me leave
Come on, whiskey drink, oh
Come on, whiskey drink

[Verse 2]
Yeah, tell me, Jack
Tell me that you got my back (That you got my back)
And that you're in it with me 'til the bottle's empty
Just like you always have
Come on, help me out (Woah, help me out)
Just get me by (Get me by)
I'd rather be hungover than cold sober
Still hung up on "goodbye"

[Chorus]
So come on, whiskey drink
I don't wanna think, think, think
About who she's with or where she is
Or how bad I miss her now
Come on, cigarette
Yeah, smoke out that regret
Pour it straight and strong, make her memory gone
Before you let me leave
Come on, whiskey drink, oh
Come on, whiskey drink

[Bridge]
It might take all night (It might take all night)
To get her off my mind (To get her off my mind)
I need you one more time (One more time)

[Chorus]
So come on, whiskey drink
I don't wanna think, think, think
About who she's with or where she is
Or how bad I miss her now (How bad I miss her now)
Come on, cigarette
Yeah, smoke out that regret (Oh, that regret)
Pour it straight and strong, make her memory gone
Before you let me leave
Come on, whiskey drink, oh-oh, yeah
Come on, whiskey drink

[Post-Chorus]
Come on, whiskey drink

[Outro]
(Be a good friend)
(Go on, be a good friend now)
(Be a good friend, whiskey drink, yeah)
