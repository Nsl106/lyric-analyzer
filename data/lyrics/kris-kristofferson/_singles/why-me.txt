[Verse 1]
Why me, Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one of the pleasures I've known?
Tell me, Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth lovin' you or the kindness you've shown?

[Chorus]
Lord help me, Jesus, I've wasted it
So help me, Jesus, I know what I am
But now that I know that I've needed you so
Help me, Jesus, my soul's in your hand

[Verse 2]
Try me, Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay all I've taken from you
Maybe, Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself on my way back to you

[Chorus]
Lord help me, Jesus, I've wasted it
So help me, Jesus, I know what I am
But now that I know that I've needed you so
Help me, Jesus, my soul's in your hand

[Chorus]
Lord help me, Jesus, I've wasted it
So help me, Jesus, I know what I am
But now that I know that I've needed you so
Help me, Jesus, my soul's in your hand

[Outro]
Jesus, my soul's in your hand
