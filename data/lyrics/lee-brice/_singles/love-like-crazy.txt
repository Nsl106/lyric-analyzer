[Verse 1]
They called him crazy when they started out
Said seventeen's too young to know what love's about
They've been together fifty-eight years now
That's crazy

[Verse 2]
He brought home sixty-seven bucks a week
Bought a little 2 bedroom house on Maple Street
Where she blessed him with six more mouths to feed
Now, that's crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
Just ask him how he did it, he'll say pull up a seat
It'll only take a minute to tell you everything

[Chorus]
Be a best friend, tell the truth, and overuse "I love you"
And go to work, and do your best, and don't outsmart your common sense
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy

[Verse 3]
They called him crazy when he quit his job
Said, "Them home computers, boy, they'll never take off"
Well, he sold his one-man shop to Microsoft
And they paid like crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
Just ask him how he made it, he'll tell you faith and sweat
And the heart of a faithful woman who never let him forget

[Chorus]
Be a best friend, tell the truth, and overuse "I love you"
Go to work, do your best, don't outsmart your common sense
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy

[Bridge]
Always treat your woman like a lady
Never get too old to call her baby
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy

[Outro]
They called him crazy when they started out
They've been together fifty-eight years now
Ain't that crazy?
