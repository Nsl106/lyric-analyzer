[Verse 1]
So I guess it's over, baby, déjà vu again
Who'd have thought that time don't stop?
And somehow, girl, the world keeps spinnin'
And guess I've turned myself into a solitary man
Ain't like I'm the only one that's in the shoes that I am

[Chorus]
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
I'm right back (I'm right back)
At the sound of lonely callin'
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
It's where I'm at (It's where I'm at)
It's the sound of teardrops fallin' down, down
A slammin' door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

[Verse 2]
I know that it might sound jaded and I have to say
I think love is overrated, but I don't like throwin' it away
I know you could probably tell me right where I went wrong
Some guys can't have all the luck if others don't sing sad songs

[Chorus]
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
I'm right back (I'm right back)
At the sound of lonely callin'
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
It's where I'm at (It's where I'm at)
It's the sound of teardrops fallin' down, down
A slammin' door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn, that's right

[Bridge]
Another lover
Another lover, crash and burn
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus]
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
I'm right back (I'm right back)
At the sound of lonely callin'
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
It's where I'm at (It's where I'm at)
It's the sound of teardrops fallin' down, down
A slammin' door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn
Yeah, I let another lover crash and burn

[Outro]
Mm, mm-mm
Mm, mm-mm
