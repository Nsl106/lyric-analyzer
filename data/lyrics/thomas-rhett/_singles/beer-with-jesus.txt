[Verse 1]
If I could have a beer with Jesus
Heaven knows I'd sip it nice and slow
I’d try to pick a place that ain’t too crowded
Or gladly go wherever he wants to go
You can bet I’d order up a couple tall ones
And tell the waitress to put 'em on my tab
Yeah, I’d be sure to let him do the talkin’
Careful when I got the chance to ask

[Chorus]
Tell me, how’d you turn the other cheek
To save a sorry soul like me?
Do you hear the prayers I send?
And what happens when life ends?
And when you think you're comin' back again?
Yeah, I’d tell everyone, but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus

[Verse 2]
If I could have a beer with Jesus
Yeah, I’d put my whole paycheck in that jukebox
And I'd fill it up with nothing but the good stuff
And sit somewhere and we couldn’t see a clock

[Chorus]
And ask him, how’d you turn the other cheek
To save a sorry soul like me?
Have you been there from the start?
How’d you change a sinner’s heart?
And is Heaven really just beyond the stars?
Yeah, I’d tell everyone, but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus

[Bridge]
Now he can probably only stay, for just a couple rounds
But I hope and pray he’s stayin' till we shut the whole place down

[Chorus]
Ask him, how’d you turn the other cheek
To save a sorry soul like me?
What’s on the other side?
Is Mom and Daddy alright?
And if it ain’t no trouble, tell them I said hi
Yeah, I’d tell everyone, but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus
Yeah, I’d tell everyone but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus
