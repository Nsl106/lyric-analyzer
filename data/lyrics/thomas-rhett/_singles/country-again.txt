[Verse 1]
I quit huntin' with my daddy, guess I didn't make the time
And it's been a year since I've seen a deer, had a smallmouth on the line
The other day, I hooked a monster, and as I reeled him in
I thought, "Man, it feels good to be country again"

[Verse 2]
I spend way less time in Nashville, more time in L.A.
My back home buddies, they quit callin', thought I had too much on my plate
But last night, we cracked some cold beers and cranked Eric Church to ten
Thought, "Man, it feels good to be country again"

[Chorus]
Yeah, I love me some California, but it sure ain't Tennessee
And my roots down there in Georgia, yeah, they started missin' me
And I wouldn't change the things I've done or the places that I've been
Man, it feels good to be country again

[Verse 3]
I traded in my Silverado, didn't need no four-by-four
Tucked my boots in the back of the closet, they didn't feel like me no more
But I dug 'em out and slipped 'em on, they've been on my feet since then
Man, it feels good to be country again

[Bridge]
Oh

[Chorus]
Yeah, I love me some California, but it sure ain't Tennessee
And my roots down there in Georgia, yeah, they started missin' me
And I wouldn't change the things I've done or the places that I've been
Man, it feels good to be country again

[Verse 4]
I traded sunsets with my wife for hours on my phone
And even when I was right beside her, I still wasn't really home
But last night, we built a fire, watched the moonlight kiss her skin
Thought, "Man, it feels good to be country again"
Man, it feels good to be country again

[Outro]
I saw the light, I found the way home
Thank you Lord, Amen
Man, it feels good to be country again
