[Verse 1]
Baby girl, you out your mind, you're way too good for me
Thinkin' 'bout the day we met, you coulda just ignored me
Here I am, layin' next to you, lookin' extra cute in the mornin'
Lookin' back, all through the past, everything before you was borin'

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the type people wishin' they'd sit next to on a flight
Top of list, who I wanna wash up on a island with
You're the dream, even if we countin' girls in magazines
It's still a mystery

[Chorus]
What's someone as beautiful as you
Doin' ridin' 'round with someone like me?
I swear, girl, you could have anyonе you choose
I should stop askin' questions 'fore you gеt up and leave
What's someone as beautiful as you
Doin' wakin' up with someone like me?
Ain't gonna lie, you could have anyone you choose
I should stop askin' questions 'fore you get up and leave

[Verse 2]
How someone as beautiful as you could just fall out of the blue?
When you're walkin' 'round in my sweater, girl, there's no better view
Spend the rest of forever just treasurin' you
Ooh, I'll follow you wherever and you know that's the truth, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the type people wishin' they'd sit next to on a flight
Top of list, who I wanna spend like every second with
You're the dream, even if we countin' girls up on the screen
Still a mystery

[Chorus]
What's someone as beautiful as you
Doin' ridin' 'round with someone like me?
I swear, girl, you could have anyone you choose
I should stop askin' questions 'fore you get up and leave
What's someone as beautiful as you
Doin' wakin' up with someone like me?
Ain't gonna lie, you could have anyone you choose
I should stop askin' questions 'fore you get up and leave

[Bridge]
I just had to let you know, know, yeah, yeah (Know, know, yeah, yeah)
I could never let you go, go, yeah, yeah (Go, go, yeah, yeah)
Oh, I just had to let you know, know, yeah, yeah (Know, know, yeah, yeah)
I could never let you go, go, yeah, yeah (Go, go, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
What's someone as beautiful as you
Doin' wakin' up with someone like me?
I swear, girl, you could have anyone you choose
I should stop askin' questions 'fore you get up and leave
