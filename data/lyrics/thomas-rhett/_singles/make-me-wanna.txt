[Verse 1]
Windows down, country sound
FM on the radio
Just me and you and the man on the moon
Cruisin' down some old back road

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, baby, don't you look at me that way
'Cause you know there's only so much I can take
'Cause you make me wanna

[Chorus]
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinkin'
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop, I'm gonna
Girl, you make me wanna

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, mm-hmm

[Verse 2]
Well, you know better than to wear that dress
It oughta be against the law, yeah
Plain and simple, girl, them dimples
Know just how to turn me on

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, baby, don't you look at me that way
'Cause you know there's only so much I can take
'Cause you make me wanna

[Chorus]
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinkin'
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop, I'm gonna
Girl, you make me wanna

[Bridge]
You make me wanna
Wake up with you in the bed of my truck
And start over again when the sun comes up

[Chorus]
You make me wanna
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinkin'
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop, I'm gonna
You make me wanna
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinkin'
Hop on out, let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop, I'm gonna
Girl, you make me wanna

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
