[Chorus]
After all the bars are closed
Tell me where you wanna go
We can find a place to park
Open the bottle and our hearts
If you want, I'll tell you anything you wanna know
After everybody leaves
And this party's just you and me
We don't gotta say we're done
We can just wait up for the sun
We still got a lot of good night left to go
After all the bars are closed

[Verse 1]
And they play the last song
Blow out the neon
Don't gotta go home
But we can't stay here
And them records all spun
But the dancin' ain't done
The night's only begun
We can go anywhere
Take a ride to the boondocks
Turn my truck to a boombox, yeah
Secret spot maybe you got

[Chorus]
After all the bars are closed
Tell me where you wanna go
We can find a place to park
Open the bottle and our hearts
If you want, I'll tell you anything you wanna know
After everybody leaves
And this party's just you and me
We don't gotta say we're done
We can just wait up for the sun
We still got a lot of good night left to go
After all the bars are closed

[Verse 2]
And you kiss me like that
Like a shot of straight Jack
Baby, you're my nightcap
Take it right back
After them after hours
Be your bartender on the kitchen counter
Wrappin' up the night, arms wrapped around ya
Baby, now we're talkin'

[Chorus]
After all the bars are closed (All the bars are closed)
Tell me where you wanna go (Where you wanna go?)
We can find a place to park
Open the bottle and our hearts
If you want, I'll tell you anything you wanna know
After everybody leaves (After everybody leaves)
And this party's just you and me (This party's just you and me)
We don't gotta say we're done
We can just wait up on the sun
We still got a lot of moonlight left to go
After all the bars are closed

[Post-Chorus]
Mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm
No, I don't care what we do
On the dark side of the moon
Just as long as I'm with you when it's time to go
After all the bars are closed

[Outro]
All the bars are closed
