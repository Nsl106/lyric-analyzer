[Verse 1]
You got someone here wants to make it alright
Someone that loves you more than life right here
You got willing arms that'll hold you tight
A hand to lead you on through the night right here

[Pre-Chorus]
I know your heart can get all tangled up inside
But don't you keep it to yourself

[Chorus]
When your long day is over
And you can barely drag your feet
The weight of the world is on your shoulders
I know what you need, bring it on home to me

[Verse 2]
You know I know you like the back of my hand
Did you know I'm gonna do all that I can right here?
I'm gonna lie with you 'til you fall asleep
When the morning comes, I'm still gonna be right here, oh, yes, I am

[Pre-Chorus]
Take your worries and just drop them at the door
Baby, leave it all behind

[Chorus]
When your long day is over
And you can barely drag your feet
The weight of the world is on your shoulders
I know what you need, bring it on home to me

[Bridge]
Baby, let me be your safe harbor
Don't let the water come and carry you away

[Chorus]
When your long day is over
And you can barely drag your feet
The weight of the world is on your shoulders
I know what you need, bring it on home to me

[Outro]
Oh, bring it on home
Yeah, bring it on home to me (Home to me)
Oh, bring it on, bring it on home to me
You got someone here wants to make it alright
Someone that loves you more than life right here
