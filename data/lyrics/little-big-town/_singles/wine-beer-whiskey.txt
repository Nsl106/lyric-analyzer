[Intro]
Woo!
(Oh, yeah)

[Verse 1]
My friend named Jack, he's got my back
He always seems to know right where I'm at
My friend Jose, he likes to play
He's always up for anything I say (Woo)

[Pre-Chorus]
Little bit of Red (Uh-huh)
A lotta bit of Crown (Oh, yeah)
Don't matter what it is, I'm gonna drink it down, down, down

[Chorus]
The wine, the beer, the whiskey
Are the only things that fix me
I'm not sayin' it's a problem, I can stop it if I wanna
But the wine, the beer, the whiskey
They always get me

[Verse 2]
My friend named Gin, she's got some friends
I'm talkin' Brandy, Sherry, and their brother Jim
My friend the captain, we call him Morgan
He likes to anchor down and hang over 'til mornin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Little bit of Red (Uh-huh)
A lotta bit of White (Oh, yeah)
Don't matter what it is, it's gonna make it all alright

[Chorus]
The wine, the beer, the whiskey
Are the only things that fix me
I'm not sayin' it's a problem, I can stop it if I wanna
But the wine, the beer, the whiskey
They always get me

[Bridge]
(Woo!)
(Oh, yeah, alright)
(Woo!)
My friend named Tito, he's my amigo
I'm gonna follow him around wherever he go (Woo)

[Chorus]
The wine, the beer, the whiskey
Yeah, I got all my friends here with me
I'm not sayin' it's a problem, I can stop it if I wanna
But who would wanna?
When the wine, the beer, the whiskey
They always get me

[Outro]
They always get me (They always get me)
They always get me
Yeah, they always get me, they get me
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo (Ha-ha-ha, brr-brr-doo)
