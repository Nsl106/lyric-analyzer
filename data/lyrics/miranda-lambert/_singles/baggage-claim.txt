[Verse 1]
I have been draggin' around your sensitive ego
Making sure that your bags arrive on time
For the dog and pony show
A little suitcase like a brick
It kinda makes it hard to get a good grip
I drop your troubles off at the conveyor belt
I'll hand you a ticket to go get it yourself

[Chorus]
At the baggage claim, you got a lot of luggage in your name
And when you hit the ground, check the lost and found
'Cause it ain't my problem now
I can't carry it on, I've got a lot of troubles on my own
It's all over the yard, in the trunk of the car
I'm packin' it in, so come and get it

[Verse 2]
If it ain't obvious what has set me off today
Behind every woman scorned is a man who made her that way
Go on and take your little business trip
With that sweet little habit that you can't kick
You better call your momma when you get to town
'Cause I ain't gonna be hangin' around

[Chorus]
At the baggage claim, you got a lot of luggage in your name
When you hit the ground, check the lost and found
Because it ain't my problem now
I can't carry it on, I've got a lot of troubles on my own
It's all over the yard, in the trunk of the car
And I'm packin' it in, so come and get it
Uh, come and get it!

[Bridge]
Come and pick it up, pick it up
Before I blow it up in flames
You better pick it up, pick it up
Baby, I'm leaving everything

[Chorus]
At the baggage claim, you got a lot of luggage in your name
And when you hit the ground, check the lost and found
'Cause it ain't my problem now
I can't carry it on, I've got a lot of troubles on my own
It's all over the yard, in the trunk of the car
Well, I'm packin' it in, so come and get it

[Outro]
Come and get your shit
