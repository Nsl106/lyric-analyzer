[Verse 1]
You've got the bullets, I got the gun
I got a hankerin' for gettin' into somethin'
I hit the bottle, you hit the gas
I heard your 65 can really haul some ass

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' frisky, you're feelin' good
I guess the whiskey is doin' what it should
I got the cigarettes, you've got a lighter
And when the sun goes down, we'll start a little fire

[Chorus]
Ain't no use in tryin' to slow me down
'Cause you're runnin' with the fastest girl in town
Ain't ya, baby?
I like 'em crazy

[Verse 3]
My reputation follows me around
Just makes me wanna give 'em more to talk about
Let's go to town for a little while
I'll be wearin' nothin' but a tattoo and a smile

[Chorus]
Ain't no use in tryin' to slow me down
'Cause you're runnin' with the fastest girl in town
Ain't ya, baby?
You're kinda crazy
Come on

[Verse 4]
I see the blue lights, we better run
Throw out the bottle and I'll hide the gun
If he pulls us over, I'll turn on the charm
You'll be in the slammer and I'll be on his arm

[Chorus]
Ain't no use in tryin' to slow me down
'Cause you're runnin' with the fastest girl in town
Ain't ya, baby?
Well, I told you I was crazy
No, I ain't nobody's baby
Hey

[Outro]
He's got the bullets, he's got a gun
I got the hankerin' for gettin' into somethin'
