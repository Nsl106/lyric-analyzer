[Verse 1]
Should I give up sunsets for marigold mornings?
Should I look for rainbows or wait for the rain?
Is happiness on the highway? Or is it parked in the driveway?
Should I lean on you, babe? Or should you lean on me?

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way?

[Chorus]
I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
One heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?

[Verse 2]
I could plant a pretty garden or just send myself flowers
Be a jet-set Friday or a Sunday hometown girl
I could stay a little lonely or let you get to know me
Yeah, I could love a picket fence if it wrapped around the world

[Chorus]
I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
I'm one heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way?

[Chorus]
I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
A caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
One heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down? (Ooh, ooh)
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
