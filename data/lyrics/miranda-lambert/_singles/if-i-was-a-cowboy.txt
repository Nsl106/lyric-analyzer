[Intro]
Oh, ooh-ooh, oh, ooh-ooh
Oh, ooh-ooh, oh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Riding off in the sunset, blue eyes under my Stetson
A little lady on the front porch wishing my heart would start settling
Big iron hips with the holsters
I'd be looking mighty fine on a poster
Wanted by the law but the laws don't apply to me

[Chorus]
If I was a cowboy, I'd be wild and free
Rolling around these towns like tumbleweeds
I'd be a legend at loving and leaving
Nipping on a whiskey and numbing up my feelings
You thought the west was wild, but you ain't saddled up with me
If I was a cowboy, I'd be the queen

[Refrain]
Oh, ooh-ooh, oh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Sitting pretty on the prairie, baby, I'm your Huckleberry, let me hold you
This six gun sugar's got a hairpin trigger, like I told you
And this dove never really gets lonesome
I never begged, never borrowed, but I stole some
Wanted by the law but the laws don't apply to me, baby

[Chorus]
If I was a cowboy, I'd be wild and free
Rolling around these towns like tumbleweeds
I'd be a legend at loving and leaving
Nipping on a whiskey and numbing up my feelings
You thought the west was wild, but you ain't saddled up with me
If I was a cowboy, I'd be the queen

[Bridge]
So mammas, if your daughters grow up
To be cowboys, so what?

[Chorus]
If I was a cowboy, I'd be wild and free
Rolling around these towns like tumbleweeds
I'd be a legend at loving and leaving
Nipping on a whiskey and numbing up my feelings
You thought the west was wild, but you ain't saddled up with me
If I was a cowboy, I'd be the queen

[Outro]
Oh, ooh-ooh, I'd be the queen
Oh, ooh-ooh, oh, ooh-ooh
Oh, ooh-ooh, oh, ooh-ooh
