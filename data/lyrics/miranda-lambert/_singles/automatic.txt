[Verse 1]
Quarter in a payphone, dryin' laundry on the line
Watchin' Sun Tea in the window, pocket watch tellin' time
Seems like only yesterday I'd get a blank cassette
Record the country countdown 'cause I couldn't buy it yet

[Verse 2]
If we drove all the way to Dallas just to buy an Easter dress
We'd take along a Rand McNally, stand in line to pay for gas
God knows that shiftin' gears ain't what it used to be
I learned to drive that '55 just like a queen, three on a tree

[Chorus]
Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doin' it all by hand
'Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time you put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic

[Verse 2]
If you had something to say, you'd write it on a piece of paper
Then you'd put a stamp on it, and they'd get it three days later
Boys would call the girls, and girls would turn them down
Stayin' married was the only way to work your problems out

[Chorus]
Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doin' it all by hand
'Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time you put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Automatic

[Bridge]
Let's roll the windows down
Windows with the cranks
Come on, let's take a picture
The kind you gotta shake

[Chorus]
Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doin' it all by hand
'Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time you put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic, yeah

[Outro]
Automatic
