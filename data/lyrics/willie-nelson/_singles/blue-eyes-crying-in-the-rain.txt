[Verse 1]
In the twilight glow I see them
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again

[Chorus]
Love is like a dying ember
And only memories remain
And through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain

[Instrumental Verse]

[Chorus]
Some day when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand-in-hand again
In a land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain
