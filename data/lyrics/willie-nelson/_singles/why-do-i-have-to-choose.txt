[Chorus]
Why do I have to choose to see everybody lose
To walk around and sing the blues well darling I refuse

[Verse 1]
Love is hard to find love of any kind
And a love like yours and mine creates it's own design

[Chorus]
Why do I have to choose to see everybody lose
To walk around and sing the blues well darling I refuse

[Verse 2]
And when I think of her and then I think of you
The love is not the same but either love is true

[Chorus]
Why do I have to choose to see everybody lose
To walk around and sing the blues well darling I refuse
