[Verse]
If you had not have fallen then I would not have found you
Angel flying too close to the ground
And I patched up your broken wing and hung around a while
Trying to keep your spirits up and your fever down

[Chorus]
I knew someday that you would fly away
For love's the greatest healer to be found
So leave me if you need to, I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground

[Instrumental Verse]

[Chorus]
So fly on, fly on past the speed of sound
I'd rather see you up than see you down
So leave me if you need to, I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground

[Outro]
Leave me if you need to, I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground
