[Verse 1]
Georgia, Georgia
The whole day through
An' just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

[Verse 2]
Georgia, Georgia
A song of you
Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pines

[Bridge]
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

[Verse 3]
Georgia, Georgia
No peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 4]
Georgia, Georgia
No peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

[Outro]
On my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On my mind
