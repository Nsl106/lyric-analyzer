[Verse 1]
Well, I woke up in places that I couldn't remember
Who's lyin' next to me or even how I got there
And that's hard to believe but that's how I used to roll

[Verse 2]
One Tuesday night, in an underground pool hall
That's where I saw her for the first time, right around last call
She stole my heart and I started walkin' down a new road

[Chorus]
And, oh, when I'm holdin' her
It's like peace on Earth
Where time stands still
And love's the only thing, yeah, that I feel
When she's in my arms
No matter where we are
Well, I am right at home
When I'm holdin' her

[Verse 3]
Now, on a park bench down on 4th Street, that's where I popped the question
And to my amazement, she actually said yes
Tears filled my eyes as I slipped a ring on her hand

[Verse 4]
Oh, then a few short years later God put into my world
A 6 pound and 8 ounce sweet baby girl
And ever since that day, let me tell you now, I became a brand new man

[Chorus]
Because when I'm holdin' her
It's like peace on Earth
Where time stands still
And love's the only thing, yeah, that I feel
When she's in my arms
No matter where... no matter where we are
Well, I am right at home
When I'm holdin' her

[Outro]
I am right at home
When I'm holdin' her
