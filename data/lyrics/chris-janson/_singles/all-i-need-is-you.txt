[Verse 1]
I want a tracker boat on a big blue lake
And a brand new truck in my driveway
Lotto ticket worth a million bucks
And a bigger one on the wall
I want my boy's ball team to win
Waylon on the radio again
I want what I want
But hey, don't we all?

[Chorus]
When that sun goes down
At the end of the day
There's just one thing I can't lose
If you're by my side
I'm better than alright
Baby, all I need is you

[Verse 2]
I wanna take a trip in a Chevrolet
To a beach house down on 30A
Have the Gulf of Mexico
Sittin' right in my backyard
But as long as you're right here in my arms

[Chorus]
When that sun goes down
At the end of the day
Thеre's just one thing I can't lose
If you'rе by my side
I'm better than alright
Baby, all I need is

[Bridge]
You in the morning, you in the night
You every day for the rest of my life
You and me together 'til the day I die
I'm all yours, if you're all my mine
Baby, you're all mine
Now, baby, look at you
You're my wildest dream
I could give it all up
And still have everything

[Chorus]
When that sun goes down
At the end of the day
There's just one thing I can't lose
If you're by my side
I'm better than alright
Baby, all I need is you

[Outro]
All I need is you
Baby, all I need is you
All I need is you
