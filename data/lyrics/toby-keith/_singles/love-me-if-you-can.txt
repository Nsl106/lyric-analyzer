[Intro]
Mm

[Verse 1]
I sometimes think that war is necessary
Every night, I pray for peace on Earth
And I hand out my dollars to the homeless
But believe that every able soul should work

[Pre Chorus]
My father gave me my shotgun
That I'll hand down to my son
Try to teach him everything it means

[Chorus]
I'm a man of my convictions
Call me wrong, call me right
But I bring my better angels to every fight
You may not like where I'm going
But you sure know where I stand
Hate me if you want to
Love me if you can

[Verse 2]
I stand by my right to speak freely
But I worry 'bout what kids learn from TV
And before all the debatin' turns to angry words and hate
Sometimes we should just agree to disagree

[Pre Chorus]
And I believe that Jesus
Looks down here and sees us
And if you ask Him, He would say

[Chorus]
I'm a man of my convictions
Call me wrong, call me right
But I bring my better angels to every fight
You may not like where I'm going
But you sure know where I stand
Hate me if you want to
Love me if you can

[Chorus]
I'm a man of my convictions
Call me wrong, call me right
But I bring my better angels to every fight
You may not like where I'm going
But you sure know where I stand
Hate me if you want to
Love me if you can

[Outro]
Mm
