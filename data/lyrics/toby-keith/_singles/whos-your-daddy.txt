[Intro]
Woo
Alright boys

[Verse]
Yeah, here you come knockin' on my door, baby
Tell me what you got on your mind
I guess those college boys all went home for the summertime
Yeah, you're looking right, looking good, looking like a woman should
So why is it so hard to find
A place to lay your pretty little head down once in a while?

[Pre-Chorus]
You run on a little tough luck baby, ha
Don't you sweat it
Everything is waiting inside for you
You know I got it
Come and get it

[Chorus]
Who's your daddy, who's your baby?
Who's your buddy, who's your friend?
And who's the one guy that you come running to
When your love life starts tumbling?
I got the money if you got the honey
Let's cut a deal let's make a plan
Who's your daddy, who's your baby?
Who's your buddy, who's your man?

[Pre-Chorus]
You might've run on a little tough luck baby, did ya
Don't you sweat it
Everything is waiting inside for you
You know I got it
So come and get it

[Chorus]
Who's your daddy, who's your baby?
Who's your buddy, who's your friend?
And who's the one guy that you come running to
When your love life starts tumbling?
I got the money if you got the honey
Let's cut a deal let's make a plan
Who's your daddy, who's your baby?
Who's your buddy, who's your man?
Who's your daddy, who's your baby?
Who's your buddy, who's your man?
