[Verse 1]
He's flyin' high tonight, he's got a brand new lover
Here you come a-runnin', you're lookin' for some cover
I know you're sad and lonely, I know you're feelin' blue
You miss him so much, won't let me get too close to you

[Chorus]
Oh, he ain't worth missin'
Oh, we should be kissin'
Stop all this foolish wishin'
He ain't worth missin'
I know your head is turnin'
I know your heart is burnin'
Girl, you gotta listen
Don't you know he ain't worth missin'

[Verse 2]
You know I'm here to save you, but you ain't through cryin' yet
Look at your pretty face, all red and soakin' wet
I'm gonna try to make him just a memory
Come on baby, let's get started, first thing you got to see

[Chorus]
Oh, he ain't worth missin'
Oh, we should be kissin'
Stop all this foolish wishin'
He ain't worth missin'
I know your head is turnin'
I know your heart is burnin'
Girl, you gotta listen
Don't you know he ain't worth missin'

[Bridge]
If you need someone to hold you
Someone to ease your pain
Well, I'll be holdin' steady
Girl, when you get ready
I'm gonna show you
Love is a good thing
Yeah, love is a good thing

[Chorus]
Oh, he ain't worth missin'
Oh, we should be kissin'
Stop all that foolish wishin'
Ooh, the boy ain't worth missin'
I know your head is turnin'
I know your heart is burnin'
Girl, you gotta listen
Don't you know he ain't worth missin'

[Outro]
Oh, he ain't worth missin'
Oh, we should be kissin'
Stop all that foolish wishin'
He ain't worth missin'
I know your head is turnin'
I know your heart is burnin'
