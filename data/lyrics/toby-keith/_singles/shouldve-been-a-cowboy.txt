[Verse 1]
I'll bet you've never heard ol' Marshal Dillon say
"Miss Kitty, have you ever thought of runnin' away
Settlin' down, would you marry me
If I asked you twice and begged you pretty please?"
She'd have said yes in a New York minute
They never tied the knot, his heart wasn't in it
He just stole a kiss as he rode away
He never hung his hat up
At Kitty's place

[Chorus]
I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearin' my six-shooter
Ridin' my pony on a cattle drive
Stealin' the young girls' hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singin' those campfire songs
Oh, I should've been a cowboy

[Verse 2]
I might've had a sidekick with a funny name
Runnin' wild through the hills chasin' Jesse James
Endin' up on the brink of danger
Ridin' shotgun for the Texas Rangers
Go west, young man, haven't you been told
California's full of whiskey, women and gold
Sleepin' out all night beneath the desert stars
With a dream in my eye, and a prayer in my heart

[Chorus]
I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearin' my six-shooter
Ridin' my pony on a cattle drive
Stealin' the young girls' hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singin' those campfire songs
Oh, I should've been a cowboy

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
I'd be wearin' my six-shooter
Ridin' my pony on a cattle drive
Stealin' the young girls' hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singin' those campfire songs
Oh, I should've been a cowboy

[Outro]
Yeah, I should've been a cowboy
I should've been a cowboy
