[Verse 1]
Day by day
We let love just walk away
And I'll be the first to say
I was glad to see it go
And day by day
Ever since you went away
I find that I am still missin' you
And I have just got to know

[Chorus]
Does that blue moon
Ever shine on you?
I want to hold you close to me
Feel just like it used to be
And, baby, if you feel like I do
You can come to me
Does that blue moon
Ever shine on you?

[Verse 2]
On my mind
You were right there all the time
I could search and never find
Someone that does me like you do
Here's the part
Where I am giving you my heart
I was a fool to let you go
Girl, I have just got to know

[Chorus]
Does that blue moon
Ever shine on you?
I want to hold you close to me
Feel just like it used to be
And, baby, if you feel like I do
You can come to me
Does that blue moon
Ever shine on you?

[Bridge]
Night after night, I look to the stars
Wondering where you might be
And I have thought to myself, is that very same moon
Shinin' on you, like it is shinin' on me

[Chorus]
Does that blue moon
Ever shine on you?
I want to hold you close to me
Feel just like it used to be
And, baby, if you feel like I do
You can come to me
Does that blue moon
Ever shine on you?
