[Verse 1]
She left a yellow rose and a long neck bottle
On a table beside my bed
With a short little note that said I had a good time
It was written in lipstick red
She didn't sign her name I wonder
If that's a little secret that she keeps
Ooh, she's walking around in my sleep

[Chorus]
Dream walkin', pillow talkin'
She's calling my name again
Day's breaking, I ain't waking up, I'm sleeping in
I'm on a roll now, I gotta know how this dream ends

[Verse 2]
She took my new sunglasses and my old jean jacket
And she never even bothered to ask
You could say I haven't seen her since late last summer
But every night she comes back
Just like smoke through the keyhole
She slips in so silently
Ooh, she's walking around in my sleep

[Chorus]
Dream walkin', pillow talkin'
She's calling my name again
Day's breaking, I ain't waking up, I'm sleeping in
I'm on a roll now, I gotta know how this dream ends

[Bridge]
Oh, there's a thin line between dreams and memories
I'll be losing my mind till she comes back to me

[Chorus]
Dream walkin', pillow talkin'
She's calling my name again
Day's breaking, I ain't waking up, I'm sleeping in
I'm on a roll now, I gotta know how this dream ends
I'm on a roll now, I gotta know how this dream ends
I'm on a roll now, I gotta know how this dream ends

[Outro]
She's walking around in my sleep
She's walking around in my sleep
