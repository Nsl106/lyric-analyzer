[Verse 1]
If I could invent a time machine
Then, baby, we'd both be seventeen
Cruisin' in my first car
Actin' like movie stars on a Friday night
Do you remember those Friday nights?

[Chorus]
When we were a rock, ready to roll
And there was a fire down in our souls
And all the whole world had to stand still
And turn around us, 'cause that was the deal
And oh, how those nights went flowing like wine
When I was all yours and you were all mine
And we were in love
Yeah, we were in love

[Verse 3]
I can still see you when I sleep
There is a picture I still keep
You with your hair in the wind
And me with that crazy grin
Under summer skies
When dreams were too young to die

[Chorus]
When we were a rock, ready to roll
And there was a fire down in our souls
And all the whole world had to stand still
And turn around us, 'cause that was the deal
And oh, how those nights went flowing like wine
When I was all yours and you were all mine
And we were in love

[Bridge]
Oh, I know, I know it sounds crazy but, baby, you're still the one
So, let's find a way to bring back the days when our hearts were forever young

[Chorus]
When we were a rock, ready to roll
And there was a fire down in our souls
And all the whole world had to stand still
And turn around us, 'cause that was the deal
And oh, how those nights went flowing like wine
When I was all yours and you were all mine
And we were in love
Yeah, we were in love
Oh, we were in love
Oh, we were in love
