[Verse 1]
Don't my baby look good in them blue jeans?
Tight on the top with a belly button ring
A little tattoo somewhere in between
She only shows to me

[Verse 2]
Hey we're going out dancin', she's ready tonight
So damn good-lookin' boys, it ain't even right
And when bartender says for the lady
What's it going to be?
I tell him, man

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She ain't into wine and roses
Beer just makes her turn up her nose, and
She can't stand the thought of sippin' champagne

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No Cuervo Gold Margaritas
Just ain't enough good burn in tequila, she needs
Somethin' with a little more edge and a little more pain

[Chorus]
She's my little whiskey Girl
She's my little whiskey Girl
My ragged-on-the-edges girl
Ah, but I like 'em rough

[Verse 3]
Baby got a '69 mustang, four on the floor
And you oughta hear the pipes ring
I jump behind the wheel and it's-a-way we go

[Verse 4]
Hey, I drive too fast, but she don't care
Blue bandana tied all up in her hair
Just sittin' there, singin' every song on the radio

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She ain't into wine and roses
Beer just makes her turn up her nose, and
She can't stand the thought of sipping' champagne

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No Cuervo Gold Margaritas
Just ain't enough good burn in tequila, she needs
Somethin' with a little more edge, and a little more pain

[Chorus]
She's my little whiskey Girl
She's my little whiskey Girl
My ragged-on-the-edges girl
Ah, but I like 'em rough

[Instrumental Break]
2:51 - 3:10

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No Cuervo Gold Margaritas
Just ain't enough good burn in tequila, she needs
Somethin' with a little more edge, and a little more pain

[Chorus]
She's my little whiskey Girl
Oh, she's my little whiskey Girl
My ragged-on-the-edges girl
Ah, but I like 'em rough

[Outro]
Yeah, I like 'em rough
I like 'em rough
