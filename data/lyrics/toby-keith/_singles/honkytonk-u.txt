[Verse 1]
My grandmother owned a nightclub on the Arkansas-Oklahoma line
Momma put me on a Greyhound and I went to stay with her in the summertime
I'd box up those empty long necks and stack 'em in the back and make a hand
Then at night she'd let me sneak out of the kitchen and sit in with the band

[Verse 2]
Yes, I have sacked some quarterbacks and broke my share of bones along the way
I knew it wouldn't last forever, semi-pro always means semi-paid
I started climbin' drillin' rig, I'm oil field trash and proud as I can be, yeah
Then I took my songs and guitar and sang 'em to a man from Tennessee

[Chorus]
I've played every beer joint tavern from New York City out to Pasadena
Every corn dog fair and rodeo and sold out every basketball arena
I like to get down with my boys in Afghanistan and Baghdad city too
I am a red, white and blue blood graduate of Honkytonk U

[Verse 3]
A star can't burn forever and the brightest ones will someday lose their shine
But the glass won't ever be half empty in my optimistic mind
I'll still have a song to sing and a band to turn it up and play it loud
As long as there's a barroom with a corner stage and a honkytonk crowd

[Chorus]
I've played every beer joint tavern from New York City out to Pasadena
Every corn dog fair and rodeo and sold out ever basketball arena
I like to get down with my boys in Afghanistan and Baghdad city too
Son I'm a red, white, and blue blood graduate of Honkytonk U
That's right a red, white, and blue blood graduate of Honkytonk U
