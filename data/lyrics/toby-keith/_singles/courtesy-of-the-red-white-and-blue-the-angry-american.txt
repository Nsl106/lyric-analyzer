[Intro]
American girls and American guys
We'll always stand up and salute, we'll always recognize
When we see Old Glory flyin', there's a lot of men dead
So, we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head

[Verse 1]
My daddy served in the army, where he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard 'til the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister, and me
To grow up and live happy in the land of the free

[Verse 2]
Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flyin' in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see it clearly through our big black eye
Man, we lit up your world like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
Hey, Uncle Sam, put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shakin' her fist
And the eagle will fly and it’s gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringin' her bell
And it'll feel like the whole wide world is rainin' down on you
Aw, brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

[Bridge]
Oh, justice will be served, and the battle will rage
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
And you'll be sorry that you messed with the U.S. of A
'Cause we'll put a boot in your ass, it's the American way

[Chorus]
Hey, Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shakin' her fist
And the eagle will fly, and it's gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringin' her bell
And it'll feel like the whole wide world is rainin' down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Of the red, white and blue
Oh, oh
Of my red, white, and blue
