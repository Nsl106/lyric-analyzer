[Verse 1]
Well, the weatherman said it might storm today
I gotta hit the field, gotta bail some hay
And I can't let it rain on my daddy's farm
'Til I get it all stacked up high in the barn
And I'm gonna call my baby, she's been waiting on me, yeah
She lives down town on Sycamore Street
And the wheels on the blacktop are startin' to whine
As I pass that Oklahoma city limit sign

[Chorus]
I'm a hayseed and a plow boy
I'm a farm kid and a cowboy
I'm a roughneck, Daddy was a roughneck too, woah
I run around with hillbilly girls
When the weekend sets on our hillbilly world
You better be ready when the sun goes down
That's when country comes to town

[Verse 2]
Well, her Daddy said, "Child, better let him be"
Well, I don't like him and he sure don't like me
Her mama just says, "Y'all have a little fun"
Said, "Ain't doing nothing me and Papa ain't done"
And I open up the door to my pickup truck
And my baby jumps in and she fires it up
And she gives me a kiss as I crawl in
We've been waiting all week for a weekend

[Chorus]
I'm a hayseed and a plow boy
I'm a farm kid and a cowboy
I'm a roughneck, Daddy was a roughneck too, woah
I run around with hillbilly girls
When the weekend sets on my hillbilly world
You better be ready when the sun goes down
'Cause that's when country comes to town

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's true I run around with hillbilly girls
When the weekend sets on our hillbilly world
You better be ready when the sun goes down
That's when country comes to town

[Outro]
Here I come
