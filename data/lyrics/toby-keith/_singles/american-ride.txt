[Verse 1]
Winter gettin' colder, summer gettin' warmer
Tidal wave come across the Mexican border
Why buy a gallon, it's cheaper by the barrel
Just don't get busted singin' Christmas carols

[Chorus]
That's us, that's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burnin'
Funny how the world keeps turnin'
Look ma, no hands
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride

[Verse 2]
Momma gets her rocks off watchin' Desperate Housewives
Daddy works his ass off payin' for the good life
Kids on the YouTube learning how to be cool
Livin' in a cruel world, pays to be a mean girl

[Chorus]
That's us, that's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burnin'
Funny how the world keeps turnin'
Look ma, no hands
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride

[Verse 3]
Poor little infamous, America's town
She gained five pounds and lost her crown
Quick fix plastic surgical antidote
Got herself a record deal, can't even sing a note

[Verse 4]
Plasma gettin' bigger, Jesus getting smaller
Spill a cup of coffee, make a million dollars
Customs caught a thug with an aerosol can
If the shoe don't fit, the fits gonna hit the shan

[Outro]
That's us, that's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burning
Funny how the world keeps turning
Hot dog, hot damn
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride
Oh, yeah

[Outro]
