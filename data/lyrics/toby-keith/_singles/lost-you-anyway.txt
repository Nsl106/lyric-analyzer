[Verse 1]
Maybe you were right
Maybe I could have changed
Sittin' here alone tonight
Thinkin' 'bout a lot of things
What's a man to say
When all the questions start?
Hell, I know deep down
Inside my broken heart

[Chorus]
Could've tried just a little bit harder
Kissed you just a little bit sweeter
Held on just a little bit longer
Dug down just a little bit deeper
Let the world revolve around you
And given you the stars above
Yeah, loved you just enough to make you stay
And I'd-a lost you anyway

[Verse 2]
I hate it when it's like this
Baby, it's like that now
Nothin' I can say to you
You even care to talk about
How you gonna dress it up
Wrap it in a pretty bow?
When it's gone, it's gone for good
Baby, at least I know

[Chorus]
Could've tried just a little bit harder
Kissed you just a little bit sweeter
Held on just a little bit longer
Dug down just a little bit deeper
Let the world revolve around you
And given you the stars above
Yeah, loved you just enough to make you stay
And I'd-a lost you anyway

[Interlude]

[Outro]
Let the world revolve around you
And given you the stars above
Loved you just enough to make you stay
And I'd-a lost you anyway
I'd-a lost you anyway
I'd-a lost you anyway
I'd-a lost you anyway
