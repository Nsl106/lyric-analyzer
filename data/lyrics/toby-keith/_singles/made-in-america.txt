[Verse 1]
My old man's that old man, spent his life livin' off the land
Dirty hands and a clean soul
It breaks his heart seein' foreign cars filled with fuel that isn't ours
And wearin' cotton we didn't grow

[Chorus]
He's got the red, white, blue flyin' high on the farm
Semper Fi tattooed on his left arm
Spend a little more at the store for a tag
In the back that says U-S-A
He won't buy nothin' that he can't fix
With WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just
Made in America

[Verse 2]
He loves his wife, but she's that wife that decorates on the 4th of July
But says, "Every day's Independence Day"
She's golden rule, teaches school, some folks say it isn't cool
But she says the Pledge of Allegiance anyway

[Chorus]
He's got the red, white, blue flyin' high on the farm
Semper Fi tattooed on his left arm
Spend a little more in the store for a tag
In the back that says U-S-A
He won't buy nothin' that he can't fix
With WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just
Made in America

[Bridge]
Born in the heartland, raised up a family
Of King James and Uncle Sam

[Chorus]
He's got the red, white, blue flyin' high on the farm
Semper Fi tattooed on his left arm
Spend a little more in the store for a tag
In the back that says U-S-A
Won't buy nothin' that he can't fix
With WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just
Made in America

[Outro]
Made in America
Made in America
Yeah, my old man's that old man
Made in America
