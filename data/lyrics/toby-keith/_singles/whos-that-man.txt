[Verse 1]
Turn left at the old hotel
I know this boulevard much too well
It hasn't changed since I've been gone
Ah, this used to be my way home

[Verse 2]
They paved the road through the neighborhood
I guess the county finally fixed it good
It was gettin' rough
Someone finally complained enough

[Verse 3]
Fight the tears back with a smile
Stop and look for a little while
Oh, it's plain to see
The only thing missing is me

[Chorus]
That's my house and that's my car
That's my dog in my back yard
There's the window to the room
Where she lays her pretty head
I planted that tree out by the fence
Not long after we moved in
There's my kids and that's my wife
Who's that man running my life?

[Verse 4]
If I pulled in, would it cause a scene?
They're not really expectin' me
Those kids have been through hell
I hear they've adjusted well

[Verse 5]
Turn around in the neighbor's drive
I'd be hard to recognize
In this pickup truck
It's just an old fixer-up

[Verse 6]
Drive away one more time
A lot of things going through my mind
I guess the less things change
The more they never seem the same

[Chorus]
That's my house and that's my car
That's my dog in my back yard
There's the window to the room
Where she lays her pretty head
I planted that tree out by the fence
Not long after we moved in
There's my kids and that's my wife
Who's that man running my life?
