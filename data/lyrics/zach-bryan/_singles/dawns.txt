[Intro: Maggie Rogers, Zach Bryan]
Mm
Mm (Ooh)

[Verse 1: Zach Bryan]
Wake me up when the season's gone
'Cause I've wasted all my dawns on you
So what do I do?
Oh, what do I do?

[Verse 2: Zach Bryan]
I get fucked up just 'cause I'm scared
Love's just another drug I have grown a victim to
So what do I do?
Oh, what do I do?

[Verse 3: Zach Bryan, Both]
All is fair in love and war
So what the hell are we even fightin' for?
I'm on your front porch beggin' for my dawns back
Give my goddamn records and my clothes back
'Cause I'm through
Oh, how I'm through

[Pre-Chorus: Zach Bryan, Both]
And by the time she wakes
I'll be halfway to my mama's home
It just dawned on me
Life is as fleeting as the passin' dawn
And it was my mistake
'Cause she never said a thing about Jesus
I miss my mother's southern drawl
And her prayin' through the walls in the evening

[Chorus: Both]
Give me my dawns back
Everything that dies makes its way back
I lost her last July in a heart attack
I need one small victory (Mm)
Give me my dawns back
'Cause everything that dies makes its way on back
I lost her last July in a heart attack
I need one small victory

[Post-Chorus: Maggie Rogers, Zach Bryan]
Ooh
Ooh

[Bridge: Zach Bryan, Both]
Wake me up when the season's gone
'Cause I've wasted all my dawns on you
So what do I do?
Oh, what do I do?

[Pre-Chorus: Maggie Rogers]
And by the time he wakes
I'll be halfway to my best friend's home
It just dawned on me
Life is as fleeting as the passin' dawn
And I shoulda told him twice
I believe in somethin' bigger than both of us
I miss goin' out to bars, shootin' stars
Not worryin' 'bout what's left of us, mm

[Chorus: Both, Maggie Rogers]
Mm, give me my dawns back
Everything that dies makes its way on back
I lost her last July in a heart attack
I need one small victory (Mm)
Give me my dawns back
Everything that dies makes its way on back
I lost her last July in a heart attack
I need one small victory

[Post-Chorus: Zach Bryan, Maggie Rogers]
Ooh (Mm)
Ooh (Ooh)

[Outro: Both]
I got fucked up just 'cause I'm scared
Love's just another drug I have grown a victim to
What do I do?
Oh, what do I do?
