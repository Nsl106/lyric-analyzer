[Verse 1]
5:34 AM, I was about to start my day
But she lay in there across me, so I stayed anyway
Arms tied, legs numb, her wrapped around my knee
Sweetest of the sunflowers, how you're the sun to me

[Verse 2]
I don’t recall what you were wearing on the first night we met
Besides the subtle cloud around you from my last cigarette
And you come from a good place with a happy family
The only bad you've ever done was to see the good in me

[Chorus]
'Cause I’ve been livin', waitin' on the day
That the good Lord willin', sends you out my way
I'vе seen hard times, bad luck, all that in-between
Sweetest of thе sunflowers, how you're the sun to me

[Verse 3]
And I remember being younger and my mother told me true
Find someone who grows flowers in the darkest parts of you
Take heed when things get hard and don't you ever turn around
'Cause you’ll find someone, someday, somewhere
That grows you to the clouds

[Verse 4]
And you walked me home that evening when I could barely walk
And you spoke to me so sweetly on the days I couldn’t talk
And now I'm seeing clearly and I’m growing up so free
Sweetest of the sunflowers, how you're the sun to me

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been livin’, waitin' on the day
That the good Lord willin', sends you out my way
I've seen hard times, bad luck, all that in-between
The sweetest of the sunflowers, how you're the sun to me
The sweetest of the sunflowers, how you're the sun to me
