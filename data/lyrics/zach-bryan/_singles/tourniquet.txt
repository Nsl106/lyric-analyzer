[Verse 1]
There's delays on the planes out of Eastern Montana
Where you told me you were leavin’ from
You've been stabbed in the back and the rest of your body
Won't you tell me where you’re bleedin' from?
If you need a tourniquet or if you wanna turn and quit
Know that I'll be by your side
You bled your whole soul into things you can't control
In a world you'll never satisfy

[Chorus]
I bandage up your body and your bones and your bad days too
Take care of the blood that your love runs through
I know all the damage that some days in this dark world does
You were laughin' last week at somethin' I dreamed of

[Interlude: Kim Hunter & Vivien Leigh]
Come say hello to Stanley first
Oh, no, not now, not now
Well, just say hello
Oh, which-which is he? Which-which one, which one is he?

[Verse 2]
When you finally feel the blood you spill into everybody else
I'll tourniquet your toes to the ground
Pull you in and hold you tight, love you through the heart of night
Spring your kind ass into town
You’ve been playin’ your guitar from arenas to the bars
Since you were old enough to rhyme a word
But your face is gettin' thinner and you’re prayin' for the winter
And I heard you fucked it up with her

[Chorus]
I bandage up your body and your bones and your bad days too
Take care of the blood that your love runs through
I know all the damage that some days in this dark world does
You were laughin' last evenin' at somethin’ I dreamed of

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I bandage up your body and your bones and your bad days too
Take care of the blood that your love runs through
I know all the damage that some days in this dark world does
She were laughin' last evenin' at somethin' I dreamed of

[Outro]
There's delays on the planes out of Eastern Montana
Where you told me you were leavin' from
You've been stabbed in the back and the rest of your body
Won't you tell me where you're bleedin' from?
