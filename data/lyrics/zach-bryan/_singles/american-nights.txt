[Verse 1]
Screen door cracked, the ball game on
Man on the porch singin' baritone
Tan line leads to that gentle place
Between her collarbone and her stone-cold face

[Verse 2]
Dockhand boys all say goodbye
To the women that they swear are gonna be their wives
They’ll be gone by the wintertime
And they don't wanna bother with no friend of mine

[Chorus]
Wet, hot, American nights
Shake your body dry under coastline light
Wet, hot, American nights
We snuck our Fords to the shore and drank a bottle bone-dry
We snuck our Fords to the shore and drank a bottle bone-dry

[Verse 3]
Davey got back from his first tour
He ain't the same boy that he was before
Twenty’s too young to nearly die
American boys are a friend of mine

[Verse 4]
Delco Danny cut a deal with the dealer
That he met out at the Rivers Casino
He got caught countin' cards, then them spades broke his heart
Then the Point Breeze boys broke his nose
Heard Mary got that job that she wanted out of town
She was better than the sum of all of us anyhow
She still stops by whenever she can
She's tougher than my brother with a balled left hand

[Chorus]
Wet, hot, American nights
Shake your body off under coastline light
Wet, hot, American nights
We snuck our Fords to the shore and drank a bottle bone-dry
We snuck our Fords to the shore and drank a bottle bone-dry

[Outro]
Screen door cracked with the ball game on
Man on the porch singin' baritone
Tan line leads to that gentle place
Between her collarbone and her stone-cold face
