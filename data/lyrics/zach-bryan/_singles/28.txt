[Verse 1]
You took a train to the south side of Boston
You showed me where your old man stayed
Took twenty-eight years of blood I was lost in
To feel loved on my own birthday
And I always felt like I's in between somethin'
Like home and somewhere far away
But tonight on the west side in a bar out in Brooklyn
I saw tears outline your face

[Chorus]
How lucky are we?
It's been a hell of a week, but you're all grown now
There's smoke seepin' out of your bloody teeth
But you're home somehow

[Verse 2]
And I'll be upstairs with the guitar I's given
When I was barely fourteen
When did McGlinchеy's get so crowded
And why are thе crowds so damn green?
I lost my mind on the streets of the city
And maybe I lost all hope too
Took twenty-eight years of blood pumpin' through me
To get to this evening with you

[Chorus]
How lucky are we?
It's been a hell of a week, but we're all grown now
There's smoke seepin' out of the bar down the street
But we're home somehow

[Chorus]
How lucky are we?
It's been a hell of a week and we're all grown now
There's smoke seepin' out of the bar down the street
But we're home somehow

[Outro]
You took a train to the south side of Boston
You showed me where your whole heart stayed
Took twenty-eight years of blood pumpin' through me
To feel loved on my own birthday
