[Verse 1]
I don't wanna bet, but my father wrote a check
That I bet his ass could never cash
He’s bettin' on the eight ball landin' in the side wall
Cold-blooded killer if you ask
But every night, he needs me to land himself a red three
Corner pocket at 12 AM
Only twelve-years-old, but I got ahold
Of a pool stick I was gifted from him

[Chorus]
My father is a bettin’ man
But I got myself a steady hand
He's sittin' in the corner with a six-pack of Corona
Bettin' that his son'll win again

[Verse 2]
Go bet another six-pack, bet I make a comeback
I know that this table's got a lean
Won't you takе me fishing? And I wanna try out
For the sevеnth grade football team
You'll probably be nothin’ but this town’s old drunkard
And die on a smoke-stained stool
But right now, he's got a bargain that he’s taken too far
On his boy's game of nine-ball pool

[Chorus]
My father was a bettin' man
But I got myself a steady hand
He's sittin’ in the corner with a six-pack of Corona
Bettin' that his son'll win again
My father was a bettin' man

[Chorus]
My father was a bettin' man
But I got myself a steady hand
He's sittin' in the corner with a six-pack of Corona
Bettin' that his son'll win again

[Outro]
I don't wanna bet, but my daddy wrote a check
That I bet his ass could never cash
He's bettin' on the eight ball landin' in the side wall
Cold-blooded killer if you ask
