[Intro: Mike Trotter, Zach Bryan]
Alright, man, I'm ready when y'all are
This is your song, Mike, let's do it
Alright, here we go
One, two, three, and

[Chorus: Mike Trotter & Tanya Trotter]
So take me down a road that's a little bit windy
To a place they still put sugar in their iced tea
Where the women are fine and the love is fair
Hey, driver, you can drop me off anywhere

[Verse 1: Zach Bryan]
Hey, driver, pull on over
I'm in a fight with God
This Carolina shoulder
Seems the place I'm gettin' off
Daddy always told me
"Never make a home on the road
While your lady's sneakin' out
And the kids are growin' old"

[Verse 2: Mike Trotter & Zach Bryan, Zach Bryan, Tanya Trotter]
Hey, driver, I've been ridin'
This lonely way too longAll the love I've had worth givin'
Was all spent on my songs
Hey, driver, the boys are gamblin'
With more than just their cards
With their bottles and their drugs
And their Bibles and their hearts
 (
Ooh
)

[Chorus: All, Mike Trotter & Tanya Trotter]
So take me down a road that's a little bit windy
To a place they still put sugar in their iced tea
Where the women are fine and the love is fair
Hey, driver, you can drop me off anywhere
Hey, driver, you can drop me off anywhere

[Verse 3: Zach Bryan, Zach Bryan & Tanya Trotter, Tanya Trotter]
Hey, driver, I've been feelin'
Like there's no point at all
The Klonopin ain't kicked in
And I missed my sister's call
Hey, driver, I'm so tired
Of the ways of this old world
Just drive until the tires melt
We'll come back when it's healed (Oh)

[Chorus: All, Mike Trotter & Tanya Trotter, Zach Bryan, Mike Trotter]
So take me down a road that's a little bit windy
To a place they still put sugar in their iced tea
Where the women are fine and the love is fair
Hey, driver, you can drop me off anywhere
Hey, driver, you can drop me off anywhere
Michael Trotter, Jr
Hey, driver, you can drop me off anywhere

[Chorus: Zach Bryan, All, Mike Trotter & Tanya Trotter, Mike Trotter]
So take me down a road that's a little bit windy
To a place they still put sugar in their iced tea
Where the women are fine and the love is fair
Hey, driver, you can drop me off anywhere
Hey, driver, you can drop me off anywhere
Hey, driver, you can drop me off anywhere
Hey, driver, you can drop me off anywhere
