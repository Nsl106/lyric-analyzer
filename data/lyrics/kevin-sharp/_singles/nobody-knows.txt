[Verse 1]
I pretend that I'm glad you went away
But these four walls close in more every day
And I'm dyin' inside
And nobody knows it but me

[Verse 2]
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm cryin' inside
And nobody knows it but me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Why didn't I say the things I needed to say?
How could I let my angel get away?
Now my world is just a-tumblin' down
I can see it so clearly, but you're nowhere around

[Chorus]
The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me

[Bridge]
Mmm, no one knows

[Pre-Chorus 2]
How blue can I get? You can ask my heart
Just like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now you know I'll be lovin' you still

[Chorus]
The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me

[Outro]
Nobody
(The nights are lonely, the days are so sad)
No one knows
(And I just keep thinking about the love that we had)
Nobody knows
(Nobody knows it but me)
(The nights are lonely, the days are so sad)
(And I just keep thinking about the love that we had)
