[Verse 1]
We decided to try going our own way for a while
And give each other some space, but I never dreamed it would be miles
I thought she would cry while she was packing up
I guess something isn't wrong enough

[Chorus]
She's sure taking it well, taking my heart and my soul
You'd think I wasn't here, falling apart, watching her go
If she knows it's killing me, you couldn't look at her and tell
My heart's breaking and she's sure taking it well

[Verse 2]
There go all of my dreams, melting like sugar in the rain
I would love to believe she's only smiling through the pain
All the tears are mine, shouldn't she be sad
After losing everything we had?

[Chorus]
She's sure taking it well, taking my heart and my soul
You'd think I wasn't here, falling apart, watching her go
If she knows it's killing me, you couldn't look at her and tell
My heart's breaking and she's sure taking it well

[Refrain]
She's sure taking it well
She's sure taking it well
She's sure taking it well
