[Verse 1]
Mount Everest, I'll climb it
No problem, just say when
The Mississippi, I'll swim it
Down to the delta and back again

[Chorus 1]
If you love somebody, it ain't that hard
If you love somebody, to go that far
Well, there ain't no limit to the things you'll do
If you love somebody the way that I do you

[Verse 2]
I'll get a ladder, a cheap guitar
And serenade you under the stars
Scream and shout, make a scene
Tell the whole world you're the girl of my dreams

[Chorus 2]
If you love somebody, that's what you do
If you love somebody, and your love is true
You don't think twice about being a fool
If you love somebody the way that I do

[Bridge 1]
You send me down the river with my soul on fire
The thought of you makes the weight of this world seem a little bit lighter

[Refrain]
If you love somebody
If you love somebody

[Bridge 2]
Ooh, send me down the river with my soul on fire
The thought of you makes the weight of this world seem a little bit lighter
Little bit lighter, taking me higher, higher

[Chorus 3]
If you love somebody, you do anything
If you love somebody, you jump up and sing
Well, there ain't no limit to the things you'll do
If you love somebody the way that I do you

[Chorus 4]
If you love somebody, that's what you do
If you love somebody, and your love is true
Well, there ain't no limit to the things you'll do
If you love somebody the way that I do you

[Outro]
The way that I do you, girl
If you love somebody
