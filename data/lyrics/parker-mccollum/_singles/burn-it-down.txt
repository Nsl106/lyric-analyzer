[Verse 1]
Goodbye, strung out on the lawn
The line between us was drawn
All I can see is you're gone and you left me here
With this house on this ground, burn it down

[Verse 2]
I'll leave my memories inside
In that bed, we loved in all night
Every word, every fight
Every feelin', stone cold, not a sound

[Chorus]
Burn it down 'til it's ashes and smoke
Burn it down to the smolderin' coals
Burn it down 'til I don't want you no more
Baby, burn it down

[Verse 3]
Every last song that I wrote
About me and you growing old
Every sliver of hope everything I know
Pile it up right now

[Chorus]
Burn it down 'til it's ashes and smoke
Burn it down to the smolderin' coals
Burn it down 'til I don't want you no more
Baby, burn it down

[Bridge]
Burn it down (Burn it, burn it, burn it)
Burn it down (Burn it, burn it, burn it)

[Chorus]
Burn it down 'til it's ashes and smoke
Burn it down to the smolderin' coals
Burn it down 'til I don't want you no more
Baby, burn it down (Burn it, burn it, burn it)

[Outro]
Burn it down (Burn it, burn it, burn it)
Burn it down (Burn it, burn it, burn it)
Burn it down (Burn it, burn it, burn it)
