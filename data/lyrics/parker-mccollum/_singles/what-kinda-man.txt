[Verse 1]
Look at that, I done stayed up all night again
I know I swore the last time would be the last time, but here I am
I ain't too sure what they want me to do
Clean up my act, I been thinkin' 'bout you
Ah, baby, here we go one more time
You know it's harder than it looks to walk that line

[Chorus]
Yeah, I've been runnin' so damn long
There ain't a woman who could settle me down
Wilder than a bat out of hell
Off the rails and blazin' through town
But then you walk in floatin' on air
And you look across the room at me
Forget the man I am, what kinda man do you need?

[Verse 2]
I swore that I would never step foot back
Inside thе union valley church again
But here I stand just north of Oklahoma
Tryin' to wash away my sins
I know damn wеll what I ought to do
I have to have you, I just can't stand to lose
Ah, baby, here we go one more time
You know I'll love you if you let me 'til the end of the line

[Chorus]
Yeah, I've been runnin' so damn long
There ain't a woman who could settle me down
Wilder than a bat out of hell
Off the rails and blazin' through town
But then you walk in floatin' on air
And you look across the room at me
Forget the man I am, what kinda man do you need?
What kinda man do you need?
What kinda man do you need?

[Chorus]
I've been runnin' so damn long
There ain't a woman who could settle me down
Wilder than a bat out of hell
Off the rails and blazin' through town
But then you walk in floatin' on air
And you look across the room at me
Forget the man I am, what kinda man do you need?
Forget the man I am, what kinda man do you need?

[Outro]
What kinda man do you need?
What kinda man do you need?
