[Verse 1]
I could tell that it was over
When her lips met mine
There was an emptiness in her voice
Hesitation when she smiled
She didn't have to say a word
It was just so plain to see
She'd found what she'd been looking for
And I knew it wasn't me

[Chorus]
I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel like a clown
Can't wash off his makeup
The life she wanted, it was gone
Prince Charming I wasn't
But I would trade a thousand Babylons
To be in her arms tomorrow
Oh, but like the tide, her love has come and gone
And it's time for me to go

[Chorus]
I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it (Now she sees right through me)
Should I hold on to what we have got?
Is it just a waste of time?
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in her eyes
I saw goodbye in her eyes

[Bridge]
I know you got somebody new now
All my candles have burned out
He is going to love the way you shine (so did I)
So did I
So don't smile at me if it ain't what you mean
(Goodbye)

[Chorus]
With that goodbye in your eyes
I know that I can't change it (Now you see right through me)
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it
I saw goodbye in your eyes
I know that I can't change it (Now you see right through me goodbye in your eyes)
Should I hold on?
We will never make it (Now you see right through me goodbye in your eyes)
Should I hold on?
Is it just a waste of time?
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in your eyes

[Outro]
I saw goodbye in your eyes
I know that it's over
