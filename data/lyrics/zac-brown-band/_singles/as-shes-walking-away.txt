[Verse 1: Zac Brown]
We never spoke a word, but every thought she had, I heard
From across the room
If we were standin' face to face, I couldn't find the words to say
Give me one more move

[Pre-Chorus 1: Zac Brown]
I don't even know her name
I guess foolish pride's to blame

[Chorus: Zac Brown]
Now I'm fallin' in love as she's walkin' away
And my heart won't tell my mind
To tell my mouth what it should say
We may have lost this battle, live to fight another day
Now I'm fallin' in love as she's walkin' away-ay-ay

[Verse 2: Zac Brown & Alan Jackson]
Wise man next to me did say, 'bout the one that got away
Son, I missed my chance
Don't you let regret take place of the dreams you have to chase
Ask her to dance, go on son

[Pre-Chorus 2: Alan Jackson]
You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith

[Chorus: Alan Jackson]
And don't be fallin' in love as she's walkin' away
When your heart won't tell your mind
To tell your mouth what it should say
We may have lost this battle, live to fight another day
Don't be fallin' in love as she's walkin' away-ay-ay

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus 2: Alan Jackson]
You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith

[Chorus: Zac Brown, Alan Jackson, Both]
And don't be fallin' in love as she's walkin' away
When your heart won't tell your mind
To tell your mouth what it should say
We may have lost this battle, live to fight another day
Don't be fallin', fallin' in, fallin' in love
As she’s walkin' away-ay-ay-ay, hey-ey-ey
