[Verse 1]
Made me grow
Then you cut me down
A north wind on a garden growing
You made me think you were mine
Then you changed your mind
Now I'm lost as a feather
In a hurricane
There's no way to measure
If I'll ever OK, OK let me tell you

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no good reason why
I can't move on
I lay my heart on these tracks
When your train comes along

[Chorus]
And it was all alright
Now it's all, all wrong
That's just how
It goes when you're gone

[Verse 2]
You may not realize
All the lies at the time but
The truth will find you
Storm is going to come
Going to wash you away like Sodom and Gomorrah

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no good reason why
I can't move on
I lay my heart on these tracks
When your train comes along

[Chorus]
And it was all alright
Now it's all, all wrong
That's just how
It goes when you're wrong

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Go out in circles
Like an old golden bed
As cold as the pillow
By your empty nightstand
Then something comes over me
I lose my head
I guess god did not make me
A one woman man

[Bridge]
I'd have a lot to give
If I still gave a damn
That's just how
It goes when you're wrong

[Chorus]
And it was all alright
Now it's all all wrong
But that's just how
It goes when you're gone

[Outro]
And it was all alright
Now it's all wrong
And that's just how
It goes when you're gone
When you're gone
When you're long long gone
