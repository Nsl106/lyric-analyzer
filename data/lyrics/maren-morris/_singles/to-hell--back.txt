[Verse 1]
Smoke was coming off my jacket and you didn't seem to mind
I left a long trail of ashes and you said, "I like your style"
Now, heartbreak ain't a competition, but I took it in a landslide
The skeletons I wanted to bury, you liked out in the light

[Chorus]
You didn't save me
You didn't think I needed saving
You didn't change me
You didn't think I needed changing
My wings are frayed and what's left of my halo's black
Lucky for me, your kind of heaven's been to Hell and back
To Hell and back

[Verse 2]
I wonder how you treasure what anyone would call a flaw
You say a pearl without the pressure wouldn't be a pearl at all
When my demons come a-callin', you don’t even bat an eye
I don’t scare you, and I guess that’s why

[Chorus]
You didn't save me
You didn't think I needed saving
You didn't change me
You didn't think I needed changing
My wings are frayed and what's left of my halo's black
Lucky for me, your kind of heaven's been to Hell and back
To Hell and back

[Bridge]
Smoke was coming off my jacket
And I left a long trail of ashes

[Chorus]
You didn't save me
You didn't think I needed saving
You didn't change me
You didn't think I needed changing
My wings are frayed and what's left of my halo's black
Lucky for me, your kind of heaven's been to Hell and back
Lucky for me, your kind of heaven's been to Hell and back
To Hell and back
To Hell and back
