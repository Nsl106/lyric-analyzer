My kind of walking the line
Was down the side of a highway
I thought I'd never get caught
In the kind of love where I'd stay
Then I ran into you
And my running was through

From the word go
I knew I'd found
Where the road ends
And love begins
From the word go
I knew I'd never go again

So many places I've been
Lord knows the walking shoes I've worn out
But I knew after being with you
I'd never been nowhere before now
All it took was a touch
To stop my heart and start love

From the word go
I knew I'd found
Where the road ends
And love begins
From the word go
I knew I'd never go again

You stopped me right in my tracks

There was no going back

From the word go
I knew I'd found
Where the road ends
And love begins
From the word go
I knew I'd never go again

From the word go
I knew I'd found
Where the road ends
And love begins
From the word go
I knew I'd never go again

From the word go
I knew I'd found
Where the road ends
And love begins
From the word go
I knew I'd never go again
