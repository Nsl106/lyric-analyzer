Oh, yellow autumn moon
You find me blue tonight
What with the summer gone
What with the fading light

No sails out on the lake
No children on the shore
No funny sun-burned nose
No little country store

I miss the sunny days
I miss the rainy days and you

(You)
I'm gonna miss you, girl, now you
(You)
I'm gonna miss you, girl, now you
(You)
I'm gonna miss you, girl, now you
(You)
I'm gonna miss you, girl

Are you a silly man?
Don't you know anything?
We're gonna stay in touch
We'll give you all a ring

We'll get the pictures out
We'll pass them all around
Our fire on the beach
My goodness, you were brown

We're gonna live again
We'll make them live again with you

(You)
I'm gonna miss you, girl, now you
(You)
I'm gonna miss you, girl, oh you
(You)
I'm gonna miss you, girl, now you
(You)
I'm gonna miss you, girl

I miss the sunny days
I miss the rainy days and you

(You)
I'm gonna miss you, girl, now you
(You)
I'm gonna miss you, girl, now you
(You)
I'm gonna miss you, girl, now you
(You)
I'm gonna miss you, girl
(Miss you, girl)

I'm gonna miss you, girl, now you
(You)
I'm gonna miss you, girl, now you
(You)
I'm gonna miss you, girl, now you
(You)
I'm gonna miss you, girl
(Miss you, girl)
