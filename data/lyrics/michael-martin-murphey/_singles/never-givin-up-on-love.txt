Stars are fallin' and the moon is shinin' bright
I can feel the teardrop in my eye
One last kiss my darlin', remember me kind
And always bear in mind someday we may meet again

Goodbye my love, goodbye, be glad we had the try
I'm never, never, never, never, never, never, never givin' up on love
I'm never, never, never, never givin' up on love

Somewhere out in this big wide world someone is waitin'
So I'm never, never, never, never givin' up on love
No, I'm never, never, never, never givin' up on love

Someday my darlin' will come to me and say
"I will love you darlin' till I die"
We will come together and we'll know right away
Love will ring and ring and ring like bells in the sky

Goodbye my love, goodbye, be glad we had the try
I'm never, never, never, never, never, never, never givin' up on love
I'm never, never, never, never givin' up on love

Somewhere out in this big wide world someone is waitin'
So I'm never, never, never, never givin' up on love
No, I'm never, never, never, never givin' up on love
Never, never, never, never givin' up on love
