Strangers again
Just like before
Not even friends
After bein' much more

Strangers again
And will be forever
It hurts when love ends
As strangers again

I always thought a stranger was
Someone I'd never met
But the one who passed me by today
I know too well to forget

We're strangers again
Back where we started
But we'll never begin
‘Cause we're strangers again

I always thought a stranger was
Someone I'd never met
But the one who passed me by today
I know too well to forget

We're strangers again
Back where we started
But we'll never begin
‘Cause we're strangers again
It hurts when love ends
As strangers again
