I've been waiting for you, baby
You've been taking your time to long
Don't be so shy
Oww, it's alright
This is one night you can't go wrong

Are you ever gonna love me?
Are you ever gonna come around?
I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know
If you ever want to hold me
Then you gotta stop holdin out
If you're gonna love me, love me now

I see others being lovers
Will that ever be you and me?
Please don't make me wonder, baby
Yes, no, maybe
What will it be?

Are you ever gonna love me?
Are you ever gonna come around?
I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know
If you ever want to hold me
Then you gotta stop holdin out
If you're gonna love me, love me now

If you're gonna love me
Love me now
I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know
Oh, are you ever gonna love me
Then love me now
I gotta know
