I used to love free and easy
Hitting the road any time I pleased
You came and turned me around
Now all I think about is settling down

That's what your love does to me
That's what your love does to me
Made me wonder what I ever saw in being free
I'm used to running
But my heart says stay

This time
There ain't no running away
That's what your love does to me
That's what your love does to me

Out every night when the sun goes down
Neon lights and the juke box sound
I used to be first in line now
It's the last thing on my mind

That's what your love does to me
That's what your love does to me
Made me wonder what I ever saw in being free
I'm used to running
But my heart says stay

This time
There ain't no running away
That's what your love does to me
That's what your love does to me

Every heart gets the chance to be untrue
There'll come a time when mine will, too
Well, don't you worry when it comes my time
My heart's gonna walk the line

That's what your love does to me
That's what your love does to me
Made me wonder what I ever saw in being free
I'm used to running
But my heart says stay

This time
There ain't no running away
That's what your love does to me
That's what your love does to me
