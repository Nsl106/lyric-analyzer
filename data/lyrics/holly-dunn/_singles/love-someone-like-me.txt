That dancing moon is on the water
Do you feel inclined romantically?
If you do, I think you oughtta
Love someone like me

Ain't no place you should be goin'
Ain't no need for you to leave
It's a lovers' night, the stars are showin'
You need to love someone like me

Someone else might try to find you
But my love can set you free
And if your heart has got a mind to
You could love someone like me

Instrumental break

Don't need luck to find good lovin'
And it don't happen magically
And, baby, tonight, oh, you don't need nothin
To love someone like me

If you've been thinkin' love won't find you
Well, honey, wait right here and see
And if your heart has got a mind to
You could love someone like me
You could love someone like me
You could love someone like me

To instrumental fade out
