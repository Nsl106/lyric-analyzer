She's her momma's baby
She's her daddy's pride an' joy
They've kept her under wraps
She ain't been hangin' out
With any ugly actin boy

Hardly ever been kissed
Twenty years of innocence
Just what I'm lookin' for
I wanna be the man
That's holdin' her hand
When she can't hold it back any more

Good little girls make some mighty wild women
Been savin' it up since the very beginnin'
When they fall in love they wanna take it to the limit
Good little girls make some mighty wild women

Well she's never been to Vegas or danced in a Honky Tonk
No trail of broken hearts
Although she looks the part
That ain't the kind of life she wants

She's waitin' for a gold ring
Before she tries her wings
That's what I'm waitin' for
I wanna be the man that's holdin' her hand
When she can't hold it back any more

Good little girls make some mighty wild women
Been savin' it up since the very beginnin'
When they fall in love they wanna take it to the limit
Good little girls make some mighty wild women
