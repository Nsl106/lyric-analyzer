[Intro]
Two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Takin' down your neighbor won't take you any higher
I burned my own damn finger pokin' someone else's fire
And I've never gotten taller makin' someone else feel small
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say, don't say nothin' at all

[Chorus]
Just ho​e your own row and raise your own babies
Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy

[Verse 2]
Nobody's perfect, we've all lost and we've all lied
Most of us have cheated, the rest of us have tried
The holiest of holies even slip from time to time
We've all got dirty laundry hangin' on the line

[Chorus]
So ho​e your own row and raise your own babies
Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Yeah, mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy

[Bridge]
Pourin' salt in my sugar won't make yours any sweeter
Pissin' in my yard ain't gonna make yours any greener
And I wouldn't know about the rocks in your shoes
So I'll just do me and, honey, you can just do you
(So go)

[Chorus]
So ho​e your own row and raise your own babies
Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
