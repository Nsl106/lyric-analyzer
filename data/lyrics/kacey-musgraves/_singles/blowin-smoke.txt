[Verse 1]
Between the lunch and dinner rush
Kelly caught that outbound bus for Vegas
And we're all out here talking trash, making bets
Lips wrapped 'round our cigarettes
She always thought she was too good to be a waitress

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Well, we all say that we'll quit someday
When our ship comes in, we'll just sail away

[Chorus]
But we're just blowin' smoke
Hey, yeah
We're just blowin' smoke
Hey, yeah
Out here goin' broke
Hey, yeah
Yeah, we're just blowin' smoke

[Verse 2]
Well, Janie got divorced again
Her ex-husband's in the pen
For two to five or five to ten longer, ha
And Brenda's traded smokes for cake
Still hadn't lost that baby weight
And that baby's 'bout to graduate from college

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I just flick an ash into the tray
And tell them both it'll be okay

[Chorus]
But I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey, yeah
I'm just blowin' smoke
(Hey, yeah) Hey, yeah
I'm out here goin' broke
Hey, yeah
Yeah, we're just blowin' smoke

[Bridge]
We all say that we'll quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake, yeah
We all say that we'll quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake

[Verse 3]
Wipe down the bar, take out the trash
Light one up and count my cash
Swear I'm never coming back again

[Chorus]
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey, yeah
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey, yeah
Out here goin' broke
Hey, yeah
Yeah, we're just blowin' smoke
