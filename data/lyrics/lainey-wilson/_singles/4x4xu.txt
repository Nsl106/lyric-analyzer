[Verse 1]
I'm the kind to take the keys
Don't sit in a shotgun seat
'Less I want to
And you make me want to
Hypnotized by the white lines
Your hands ten and two on this heart of mine
Makes me feel at home
Yeah, boy, I'm right at home

[Chorus]
In a 4x4 by you, babe
From the Bayou to Kentucky
City to the country
From here to Timbuktu
Boy, after a long day
Ya know there ain't no wrong way
To drive my crazy crazy
In a 4x4 by you

[Verse 2]
Parked out in the driveway
Backed up to a fire on a tailgate
Feet on the dashboard
Oh, nothin' I love more
Ninety to nothing, but we in slow motion
Up in the mountains or down by the ocean
It's all the same to me
Ain't nowhere I'd rather be

[Chorus]
Than in a 4x4 by you, babe
NYC to LA
City to the country
From here to Kalamazoo
Boy, after a long day
You know there ain't no wrong way
To drive my crazy crazy
In a 4x4 by you

[Bridge]
Right there beside you
Every morning sun
Every afternoon
Fly me to the stars
Fly me to the moon

[Chorus]
In a 4x4 by you, babe
From the Bayou to Kentucky
City to the country
From here to Timbuktu
Boy, after a long day
You know there ain't no wrong way
To drive my crazy crazy
In a 4x4 by you

[Outro]
And, boy, after a long day
You know there ain't no wrong way
To drive my crazy crazy
In a 4x4 by you
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
