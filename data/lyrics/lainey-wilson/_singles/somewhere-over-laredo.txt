[Verse 1]
Caught me a red-eye flight out of Houston
Found me a window seat with a view
Headed out west for South California
One Titos in, I'm thinkin' 'bout you

[Pre-Chorus]
In that little border town
Where the desert glows gold
When the sun goes down
My head's thirty thousand feet in the clouds
Knowin' twenty minutes from now

[Chorus]
I'll be somewhere over Laredo
Dreamin' about those rodeo nights
Laid there on the banks of the Rio
New silver buckle on your jeans next to mine
Couple wrong for each other
Lonestar-crossed lovers
Born to get gone from the get-go
But you're on my mind every time I'm chasin' this neon rainbow
Somewhere over Laredo

[Verse 2]
I'm flyin' high on a 737
Yeah, boy, I'm eye level with these stars
You think I'd be five miles closer to Heaven
But I reckon Heaven's down there where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you stop and stare at the Texas sky
Up in the air and wonder if I'm

[Chorus]
Somewhere over Laredo?
Dreamin' about those rodeo nights
Laid there on the banks of the Rio
New silver buckle on your jeans next to mine
Couple wrong for each other
Lonestar-crossed lovers
Born to get gone from the get-go
But you're on my mind every time I'm chasin' this neon rainbow
Somewhere over Laredo

[Bridge]
Where the blackbirds fly
Once in a lullaby
For a second, I'm still yours
And you're still mine

[Chorus]
Somewhere over Laredo
Dreamin' about those rodeo nights
Laid there on the banks of the Rio
New silver buckle on your jeans next to mine
Couple wrong for each other
Lonestar-crossed lovers
Born to get gone from the get-go
But you're on my mind every time I'm chasin' this neon rainbow
Somewhere over Laredo

[Outro]
Ooh
Somewhere over Laredo
Somewhere over Laredo
