[Intro]
Wildflowers
Wild horses

[Verse 1]
In the middle of the night
I hear a corn field coyote cry
Up at the moon no matter what
Sky I'm laying under
In the eye of a hurricane
When I got one foot in the grave
I'll dig my boots into the dirt
And face the rolling thunder

[Chorus]
I'm five generations
Of blazing a trail
Through barbed wired valleys and overgrown dells
I'm barefoot and bareback and born tough as nails
Whoa-ooh-oh, ooh-oh
I'm four fifths of reckless
And one fifth of jack
I push like a daisy through old sidewalk cracks
Yeah, my kinda crazy's still running its courses
With wildflowers and wild horses

[Verse 2]
It's in thе water in my veins
That bread of hеaven falls like rain
So I'm taken care of either way
Make something out of how I'm made
Until I hitch a ride on glory's train

[Chorus]
I'm five generations
Of blazing a trail
Through barbed wired valleys and overgrown dells
I'm barefoot and bareback and born tough as nails
Whoa-ooh-oh, ooh-oh
I'm four fifths of reckless
And one fifth of jack
I push like a daisy through old sidewalk cracks
Yeah, my kinda crazy's still running its courses
With wildflowers and wild horses

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'm five generations
Of blazing a trail
Through barbed wired valleys and overgrown dells
I'm barefoot and bareback and born tough as nails
Whoa-ooh-oh, ooh-oh
I'm four fifths of reckless
And one fifth of jack
I push like a daisy through old sidewalk cracks
Yeah, my kinda crazy's still running its courses
With wildflowers and wild horses

[Outro]
Yeah, my kinda crazy's still running its courses
With wildflowers and wild horses
Wildflowers and wild horses
