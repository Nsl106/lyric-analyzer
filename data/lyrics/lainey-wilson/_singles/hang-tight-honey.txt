[Intro]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1]
I got a bus 'fore I got a house 'cause that's what dreams make you do
Hittin' them neon honky-tonks to play a two-step or two
Two hundred days to a hundred towns, bringin' boots to a sawdust floor
While this 6 string calls my name, baby, I'll be missin' yours

[Chorus]
Hang tight honey I'm a white line runnin'
Down a dream on a long-lost highway
Me and this band playin' one-night stands
For some fans gettin' straight up sideways
But baby I miss your blue-collar kiss
Just one more day to get through
Hang tight honey got a pocket full of money
And I'm headed straight home to you

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2]
Yeah you can't hold me and I can't hold you, from two time zones away
When you're clocking out yeah I'm clockin' in, gettin' ready to hit the stagе
Just know they're singing along to all them songs I wrotе about you
And I'll be savin' all my lovin' for you come Sunday afternoon

[Chorus]
Hang tight honey I'm a white line runnin'
Down a dream on a long-lost highway
Me and this band playin' one-night stands
For some fans gettin' straight up sideways
But baby I miss your blue-collar kiss
Just one more day to get through
Hang tight honey got a pocket full of money
And I'm headed straight home to you

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm comin' home to you, baby

[Bridge]
Hang tight honey
Every good run comes to an end
Hang tight honey
'Til I'm in your arms again

[Chorus]
Hang tight honey I'm a white line runnin'
Down a dream on a long-lost highway
Me and this band playin' one-night stands
For some fans gettin' straight up sideways
But baby I miss your blue-collar kiss
Just one more day to get through
Hang tight honey got a pocket full of money
And I'm headed straight home to you
Hang tight honey got a pocket full of money
And I'm headed straight home to you

[Outro]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'm headed straight home to you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'm headed straight home to you
