[Verse 1]
I finally asked you to dance on the last slow song
Beneath that moon that was really a disco ball
I can still feel my head on your shoulder
And hoping that song would never be over

[Chorus]
I haven't seen you in ages
Sometimes I find myself
Wondering where you are
For me, you'll always be eighteen
And beautiful
And dancing away with my heart

[Verse 2]
I brushed your curls back so I could see your eyes
And the way you moved me was like you were reading my mind
I can still feel you lean in to kiss me
I can't help but wonder if you ever miss me

[Chorus]
I haven't seen you in ages
Sometimes I find myself
Wondering where you are
For me, you'll always be eighteen
And beautiful
And dancing away with my heart

[Bridge]
You were headed off to college at the end of that summer, and we lost touch
I guess I didn't realize, even at the moment we lost so much

[Chorus]
I haven't seen you in ages
Sometimes I find myself
Wondering where you are
For me, you'll always be eighteen
And beautiful
And dancing away with my heart

[Outro]
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Away with my heart
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
