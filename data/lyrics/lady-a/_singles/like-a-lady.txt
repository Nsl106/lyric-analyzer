[Intro]
Lady
Lady

[Verse 1]
Boy, I'm not the kinda girl to go and fight for all your attention
Mm-mm
I'm not too afraid to call this off and go see what I've been missing
Mm-mm
Leave the dress at home 'cause it makes me too polite
No more waiting by the phone
I'm stepping out tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause I feel like a lady
Sippin' on tequila with my Levi's on
A lady
Singin' to the music playin' all night long
Yeah, I'm feeling right, I'm living my life, I do what I like
'Cause I feel like a lady, a lady

[Verse 2]
Treat myself to what's up on the highest shelf
I want it, I get it, mm-mm
I might look like I'm lonely, but I'm only loving every minute
Ooh, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Leave the heels at home 'cause they never do me right
Going dancing on my own
Man, these hips don't lie

[Chorus]
'Cause I feel like a lady
Sippin' on tequila with my Levi's on
A lady
Singin' to the music playin' all night long
Yeah, I'm feeling right, I'm living my life, I do what I like
'Cause I feel like a lady, a lady
Feel like a lady, a lady, yeah

[Bridge]
Might change my hair and change my mind
Might change your whole damn life
I might break your heart and not think twice
That's right

[Chorus]
I'm a lady
Sippin' on tequila with my Levi's on
A lady
Singin' to the music playin' all night long
I'm feeling right, I'm living my life, I do what I like
'Cause I feel like a lady, a lady, yeah

[Outro]
(I feel like, I feel like a lady) Woo
(I feel like, I feel like a lady) I feel like, feel like a lady
(I feel like, I feel like a lady) Like a lady
(I feel like)
Lady
