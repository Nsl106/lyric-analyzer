[Verse 1]
You're hit then miss, you're fire and ice
You're water and whiskey burn
We kiss, we fight, make up all night
You're the blessin' and the curse
But I don’t ever wanna break this chain
I don’t ever wanna walk away
'Cause I ain't ever gonna find another lover
Make me feel this way
[Pre-Chorus]
Over and over and over, we say that we're through
But I come right back to you

[Chorus]
There's a long stretch of love comin' down the line
I'm your rock that won’t ever roll, and baby, you'll be mine
I'll be right here beside you when these good times get tough
Baby, we're in for a long stretch of love

[Verse 2]
You lift me up, you bring me down
You make me feel alive
You send my heart in overdrive
Every time you kill the lights

[Pre-Chorus]
Over and over and over, we play this game
Win or lose, we'll never change

[Chorus]
There's a long stretch of love comin' down the line
I'm your rock that won’t ever roll, and baby, you'll be mine
I'll be right here beside you when these good times get tough
Baby, we're in for a long stretch of love

[Bridge]
Long stretch of love, long stretch of love, long stretch of love
Over and over and over, we play this game
Win or lose, we'll never change

[Chorus]
There's a long stretch of love comin' down the line
I'm your rock that won’t ever roll, and baby, you'll be mine
I'll be right here beside you when these good times get tough
Baby, we're in for a long stretch of love
Long stretch of love
Long stretch of love
Long stretch of love (Ooh, baby)

[Outro]
I don't wanna break this chain
I ain't gonna walk away
In this long stretch of love
