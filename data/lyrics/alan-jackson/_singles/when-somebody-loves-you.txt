[Verse 1]
When your heart is all alone every second
Seems so long
When it's just you, you can't see through
Those old clouds that rain so blue

[Chorus]
But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
The way I love you

[Verse 2]
When it's late, the sun hangs low
By yourself, nowhere to go
Sing a song, you dance alone
Play solitaire and stare at the phone

[Chorus]
But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
The way I love you

[Verse 3]
So let's put aside our foolish pride
And let our hearts say hello
We both agree we're just no good
At being on our own

[Chorus]
But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
The way I love you

[Outro]
The way I love you
The way I love you
