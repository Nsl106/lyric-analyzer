[Verse 1]
Let's begin with the day I met her
And how fast this good ole boy's world got better
Sky got bluer, the grass got greener
Just the first few seconds after I'd first seen her

[Verse 2]
Like my favorite song on a new set of speakers
My best old jeans and my broke-in sneakers
A home run pitch floatin' right down the middle
The sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle

[Chorus]
She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
And when it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls-eye perfect
She's right on the money

[Verse 3]
She's no red lights when I've overslept
She's a three point jump shot that's nothing but net
A hand full of aces, when the dealer's done dealin'
I'm forever on a roll, that's how she's got me feeling

[Chorus]
She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
And when it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls-eye perfect
She's right on the money

[Bridge]
She's the best cook that's ever melted cheese
I ain't much around the house, but I aim to please
There's absolutely no reason to doubt her
When she says I wouldn't last ten minutes without her

[Chorus]
She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
And when it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls-eye perfect
She's

[Outro]
Ohhhh, right on the money
She goes directly to my heart
And when it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls-eye perfect
She's
(Pop) right on the money
Oh, yeah
(Whistling)
