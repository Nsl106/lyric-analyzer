[Verse 1]
Here I am alone again tonight in this old empty house
It's hard to learn what you don't think you need, that you can't live without
Never leave the sound of the telephone
But ever since you left, I've been gone

[Chorus]
Gone crazy, going out of my mind
I've asked myself the reasons at least a thousand times
Going up and down this hallway, trying to leave the pain behind
Ever since you left, I've been gone

[Verse 2]
I never saw your face this many times when you were really here
The things you said I never understood now are crystal clear
Never spent this much time alone
But ever since you left, I've been gone

[Chorus]
Gone crazy, going out of my mind
I've asked myself the reasons at least a thousand times
Going up and down this hallway, trying to leave the pain behind
Ever since you left, I've been gone

[Outro]
I've been gone
I've been gone
I've been gone, gone
Gone, I've been gone
Gone, I've been gone
