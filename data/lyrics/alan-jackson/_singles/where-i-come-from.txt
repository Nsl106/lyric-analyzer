[Verse 1]
Well, I was rollin' wheels and shiftin' gears 'round that Jersey Turnpike
When Barney stopped me with his gun ten minutes after midnight
Said, "Sir, you broke the limit, in this rusty old truck
I don't know about that accent, son, just where did you come from?"

[Chorus]
I said, "Where I come from, it's cornbread and chicken"
Where I come from, a lot of front porch sittin'
Where I come from, tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven, where I come from

[Verse 2]
Well, I was south of Detroit City, I pulled in this country kitchen
To try their brand of barbecue, the sign said finger-lickin'
Well, I paid the tab, and the lady asked me how'd I like my biscuit
"I'll be honest with you ma'am, it ain't like mama fixed it"

[Chorus]
'Cause where I come from, it's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from, lot of front porch pickin'
Where I come from, tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven, where I come from

[Verse 3]
I was chasin' sun on 101, somewhere around Ventura
And I lost a universal joint, and I had to use my finger
This tall lady stopped and asked if I had plans for dinner
Said, "No, thanks, ma'am, back home, we like the girls who'd sing soprano"

[Chorus]
'Cause where I come from, it's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from, a lot of front porch sittin'
Where I come from, tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven, where I come from

[Verse 4]
Well, I was headin' home on 65, somewhere around Kentucky
And the CB rang for the bobtail rig, it's rollin' on like thunder
Well, I answered him and he asked me, "Aren't you from out in Tulsa?"
"Nah, but you might've seen me there, I just dropped a load of salsa"

[Chorus]
Where I come from, it's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from, a lot of front porch pickin'
Where I come from, tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven, where I come—
Where I come from, yeah, it's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from, a lot of back porch pickin'
Where I come from, tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven, where I come from

[Outro]
Where I come from
Yeah, where I come from
A lot of front porch sittin'
And starin' up at heaven, where I come from
Where I come from
Trying to make a livin'
Oh, where I come from
Where I come from
