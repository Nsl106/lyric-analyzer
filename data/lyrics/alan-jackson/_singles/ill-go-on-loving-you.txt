[Verse 1]
When I look into your soft green eyes
When I see your delicate body
Revealed to me as you slip off your dress
I'm reminded that what I feel for you will remain strong and true
Long after the pleasures of the flesh

[Chorus]
And I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you

[Verse 2]
Be it the wind or the rain or the moon up in the sky
The spin of the earth or the changes in the tide
I don't know what brought us together
What strange forces of nature
Conspire to construct the present from the past

[Chorus]
And I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you

[Verse 1]
When I look into your soft green eyes
When I see your delicate body
Revealed to me as you slip off your dress
I'm reminded that what I feel for you will remain strong and true
Long after the pleasures of the flesh

[Chorus]
And I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you

[Outro]
I'll go on loving you
