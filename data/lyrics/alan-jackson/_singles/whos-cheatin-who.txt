[Verse 1]
Everywhere you look, you can write a book
On the trouble with a woman and a man
But you can not impose, you can't stick your nose
Into something that you don't understand

[Chorus]
But still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who, who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
And whose car is parked next door

[Verse 2]
I thought I knew her well, I really couldn't tell
That she had another lover on her mind
You see it felt so right when she held me tight
How could I be so blind?

[Chorus]
But still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who, who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
Whose car is parked next door
Guitar

[Verse 3]
A heart is on the line each and every time
Love is stolen in the shadows of the night
Though it's wrong all along it keeps going on
As long as you keep it outta sight

[Chorus]
But still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who, and who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
Whose car is parked next door

[Chorus]
Still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who, and who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
And whose car is parked next door
But still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who, and who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
Whose car is parked next door
