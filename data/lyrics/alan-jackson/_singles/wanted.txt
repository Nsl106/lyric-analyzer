[Verse 1]
Excuse me, Ma'am, can you help me?
I need to place an ad with you today
No, ma'am, tomorrow may be too late
I'd like to have it started right away

[Verse 2]
What's that? Naw, this is personal
I'm not buying or selling anything
Yes, ma'am, I know just what to say
I wrote it down, this is how it should read

[Chorus]
Wanted: one good-hearted woman
To forgive imperfections
In the man that she loves
Wanted: just one chance to tell her
How much he still loves her
He can't be sorry enough

[Verse 3]
What's that? Naw, that's all I want to say
I just hope these few lines will get to her
Yes, ma'am, she means everything
An' I hope she comes back when she reads these words

[Chorus]
Wanted: one good-hearted woman
To forgive imperfections
In the man that she loves
Wanted: just one chance to tell her
How much he still loves her
He can't be sorry enough

[Outro]
Wanted
