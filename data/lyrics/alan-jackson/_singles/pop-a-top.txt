[Chorus]
Pop a top, again
I've just got time for one more round
Set em' up my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let
Some other fool sit down

[Verse 1]
I'd like for you to listen to a joke I heard today
From a woman who said she was through
And calmly walked away
I tried to smile, and did a while, but it felt so outta place
Did you ever hear of a clown with teardrops
Streamin' down his face?

[Chorus]
Pop a top, again
I think I'll have another round
Set em' up my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let
Some other fool sit down

[Verse 2]
Home for me, is misery and here I'm wastin' time
Cause a row of fools on a row of stools
Is not what's on my mind
But then you see her leaving me; it's not what I prefer
So, it's either here just drinkin' beer
Or home remembering her

[Chorus]
Pop a top, again
I think I'll have another round
Set em' up my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let
Some other fool sit down

[Outro]
Pop a top, again
