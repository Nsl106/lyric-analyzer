[Verse 1]
Smiles in the morning
As warm as sunshine
Kisses when I lay down at night
And 2 loving arms
To console me
I should be scared, it's so right

[Chorus]
But, too much of a good thing
Is a good thing
Feelings like this can't be wrong
And, too much of a good thing
Is a good thing
And we've got a good thing going on

[Verse 2]
You look in my eyes
And see my thinking
I know when you're happy, when you're sad
Someone said
It's too perfect
But, I don't think what we have is so bad

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And we've got a good thing going on
