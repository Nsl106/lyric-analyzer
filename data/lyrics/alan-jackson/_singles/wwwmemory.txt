[Verse 1]
I know your leavin' I see the signs
Your going to walk out on this heart of mine
You'll never call me, you'll never write
You made your mind up and you're gone tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
If some rainy day you're all alone
And feel like talking you can log me on

[Chorus]
At www. memory
I'll be waitin' for you patiently
If you feel the need just click on me
At www. memory

[Bridge]
You won't even have to hold me or look into my eyes
You can tell me that you love me through your keyboard and wires
No you won't have to touch me or even take my hand
Just slide your little mouse around until you see it land

[Chorus]
At www. memory
I'll be waitin' for you patiently
If you feel the need just click on me
At www. memory

[Outro]
If you feel like love just click on me
At www. memory
