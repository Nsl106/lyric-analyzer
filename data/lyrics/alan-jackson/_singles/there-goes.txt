[Verse 1]
There you were standin' in the shadows
Well I just looked where I don't see
I'm still pretendin' I don't need you
I won't let you know you're killin' me

[Verse 2]
Like some big black widow spider
You know just how to catch your prey
I'm actin' like it doesn't matter
And you sneak up from behind and whisper my name

[Chorus]
And there go your paralyzin' eyes
There goes your tantalizin' smile
There goes my act of playin' it cool
And there go the words I meant to say
There go the games I wanted to play
There goes my heart fallin' for you

[Verse 3]
Well I think you're playin' with me darlin'
You like to see what you can do
Well I should be fishin' for Blue Marlin
Instead of bein' hooked by again by you

[Chorus]
But there go your paralyzin' eyes
There goes your tantalizin' smile
There goes my act of playin' it cool
And there go the words I meant to say
There go the games I wanted to play
There goes my heart fallin' for you

[Outro]
Yeah there go your paralyzin' eyes
There goes your tantalizin' smile
There goes my heart fallin' for you
Yeah there goes my heart fallin' for you
