[Verse 1]
I’ll be the bad guy
I’ll take the black eye
When I walk out
You can slam the door
I’ll be the S.O.B
If that’s what you need from me
So you don’t have to love me anymore
When you and our friends talk
Make it all my fault
Tell ‘em I’m rotten to the core
I’ll let it all slide
Get ‘em all on your side
So you don’t have to love me anymore

[Chorus]
I will keep
All those memories, of the good times
Yeah, there were some good times
So when you think
Of you and me
They won’t even cross your mind

[Verse 2]
If the wine you’re drinking
Leads you to thinking
That you want what we had before
Girl you can call me
I’ll let it ring and ring
So you don’t have to love me anymore

[Chorus]
I will keep
All those memories, of the good times
Yeah, there were some good times
So when you think
Of you and me
They won’t even cross your mind

[Outro]
If you need me to make you cry
I don’t want to but I’ll try
So you don’t have to love me anymore
