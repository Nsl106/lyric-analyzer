[Verse 1]
Daddy won a radio, he tuned it to a country show
I was rocking in the cradle to the crying of a steel guitar
Mama used to sing to me, she taught me that sweet harmony
Now she worries 'cause she never thought I'd ever really take it this far
Singing in the bars

[Chorus]
And chasing that neon rainbow, living that honky-tonk dream
'Cause all I've ever wanted is to pick this guitar and sing
Just trying to be somebody, just wanna be heard and seen
I'm chasing that neon rainbow, living that honky-tonk dream

[Verse 2]
An atlas and a coffee cup, five pickers in an old Dodge truck
Heading down to Houston for a show on Saturday night
This overhead is killing me, half the time I sing for free
When the crowd's into it, lord, it makes this thing I'm doing seem right
Standing in the spotlight

[Chorus]
And chasing that neon rainbow, I'm-a living that honky-tonk dream
'Cause all I've ever wanted is to pick this guitar and sing
Just trying to be somebody, just wanna be heard and seen
I'm chasing that neon rainbow, living that honky-tonk dream

[Verse 3]
Daddy's got a radio, he won it thirty years ago
He said, "Son, I just know we're going to hear you singing on it someday"
I made it up to Music Row, but lordy, don't the wheels turn slow
Still I wouldn't trade a minute and I wouldn't have it any other way
Just show me to the stage

[Chorus]
I'm chasing that neon rainbow, I'm-a living that honky-tonk dream
'Cause all I've ever wanted is to pick this guitar and sing
Just trying to be somebody, just wanna be heard and seen
I'm chasing that neon rainbow, living that honky-tonk dream

[Outro]
Oh, I'm chasing that neon rainbow, living that honky-tonk dream
