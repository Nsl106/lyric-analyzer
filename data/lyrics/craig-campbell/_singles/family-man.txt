[Verse 1]
I've been working as a temp
At the local factory
I hope they hire me on full time
I got shoes to buy and mouths to feed
I drive a buy-here, pay-here truck
It ain't new, but it is to me
Now it ain't much, but it fires right up
And gets me from A to B

[Pre-Chorus]
What puts the dirt underneath my nails?
What keeps the calluses on my hands?
Family, man

[Chorus]
They're the world my world revolves around
My sacred piece of solid ground
The flesh and bone that gives me strength to stand
They're the fire in my driving on
The drive behind my coming home
The living, breathing reason that I am
A family man

[Verse 2]
There's dirty shirts to wash
Dishes in the sink to do
And there's, "How many times does seventeen go into fifty-two?"
There's bedtime prayers to pray
"Sleep tights" and "I love yous"
And then there's a pair of eyes I get to lose myself into

[Pre-Chorus]
What keeps me keeping the faith?
What makes me believe I can?
Family, man

[Chorus]
They're the world my world revolves around
My sacred piece of solid ground
The flesh and bone that gives me strength to stand
They're the fire in my driving on
The drive behind my coming home
The living, breathing reason that I am
A family man

[Post-Chorus]
They're the fire in my driving on
The drive behind my coming home
The living, breathing reason that I am
A family man

[Outro]
A family man
Mm
