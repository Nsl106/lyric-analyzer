[Verse 1]
I rode around long enough
With my windows down
Let that breeze roll in, carry your perfume out
I took your number and messages off my phone
Oh, but you ain't gone

[Chorus]
Wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
You're dancing all around it, girl, you got me surrounded
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
I got you off of these walls, I got you outta my bed
But girl, I'm no better off, can't get you outta my head

[Verse 2]
Seems like your memory has got a map of my mind
No matter where I go, you find me every time
Alone or in a crowd, I hear you whispering, baby
And it's driving me crazy

[Chorus]
Wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
You're dancing all around it, girl, you got me surrounded
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
I got you off of these walls, I got you outta my bed
But girl, I'm no better off, can't get you outta my head

[Bridge]
Damn, you're hard to forget
Oh-oh, oh

[Chorus]
Yeah, wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
You're dancing all around it, you still got me surrounded
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
I got you off of these walls, I got you outta my bed
But girl, I'm no better off, can't get you outta my head
You're nowhere close to being gone outta my head

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, outta my head

[Outro]
No, you ain't gone
No, you ain't gone
Yeah, outta my head
