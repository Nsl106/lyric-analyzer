[Verse 1]
Sometimes I think what turned her on
Was my old broke down boots
She wanted her a real cowboy
It was a phase she was goin' through

[Verse 2]
Not one week after she moved in
I caught her paintin' the bedroom blue
She brought home a bottle of pink Chablis
Poured out my best homebrew

[Pre-Chorus]
I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls
As she packed her things to leave
She changed her mind when she couldn't change me

[Chorus]
She changed direction, headed out west
Changed her tune to some hip-hop mess
Her dark brown hair went to blonde
And her pretty blue eyes went to green
She changed everything when she couldn't change me

[Verse 3]
She was sittin' beside the ocean
Looking out at the waves
Watching how they keep on rollin'
But always seem the same

[Verse 4]
She called and said she'd been thinkin' about
All those quiet country nights
And whatever she thought was so wrong with me
Suddenly seemed alright

[Pre-Chorus]
I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls
When her truck pulled into view
She said I changed my mind when I couldn't change you

[Chorus]
She changed direction, headed back home
She changed her tune, it's all Haggard and Jones
Had her dark brown hair pulled back
And the bluest eyes you've ever seen
She changed everything when she couldn't change me

[Bridge]
She said "I guess when you love someone
You just gotta let it be"
And she changed her mind when she couldn't change me

[Chorus]
She changed direction, she's back in my arms
She thought it though, had a change of heart
She said I guess when you love someone
You just gotta let it be
She changed her mind when she couldn't change me

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
She changed it all when she couldn't change me
She couldn't change me
She couldn't change me
