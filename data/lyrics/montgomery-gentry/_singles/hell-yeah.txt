[Verse 1]
He works way too much
For way too little
He drinks way too early 'til
Way too late
He hasn't had a raise
Since New Year's Day
In eighty-eight
Gets trampled on by everyone, 'cept
When he comes in here

[Verse 2]
And he's the product
Of the Haggard generation
He's got a redneck side
When you get him agitated
He got the gold toothed look
From a stiff right hook
He's proud he took
For his right wing stand on Vietnam
Says he lost his brother there

[Bridge]
He yells out Johnny Cash
And the band starts to play
A-ring of fire as he walks up
And stands there by the stage
And he says

[Chorus]
A-hell yeah!
A-turn it up!
A-right on!
A-hell yeah!
A-sounds good!
Sing that song!
A guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
Life was good and love was easy

[Verse 3]
She's got an MBA and a plush corner office
She's got a don't mess with me attitude
She'll close a deal
She don't reveal that she can feel
The loneliness the emptiness
'cept when she comes in here

[Verse 4]
And she's the product of the Me generation
She's got a rock and roll side
When you get her agitated
She got the tattoo there
On her derriere
From a spring break dare in Panama
Where love was all she thought she'd ever need

[Bridge]
She yells out to the band
Know any Bruce Springsteen?
Then she jumps up on the bar
And she, and she starts to scream
She says

[Chorus]
Hell yeah!
Turn it up!
A-right on!
A-hell yeah!
A-sounds good!
Sing that song!
A guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
Life was good
Love was easy

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
Can or can't you get my mind off thinkin' 'bout
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Hey, hell yeah!

[Instrumental Break]
3:02 - 3:24

[Chorus]
Hell yeah
Turn it up
Right on
Hell yeah
Sounds good
Sing that song
A guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
Life was good

[Chorus]
Hell yeah!
A-turn it up!
A-right on!
Hell yeah!
A-sounds good!
Sing that song!
A guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
When life was good
And love was easy
