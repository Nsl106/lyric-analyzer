Sometimes I swear I live with an angel
Sent from above to watch over me
He wears his love just like a halo
If he's not an angel, what else can he be
He wouldn't say he's anything special
Betcha that's how all those angels are
But when he comes around miracles happen
I felt the first one when he touched my heart

Though I've never seen him fly
On the wings of love he carries me
Heaven bound I'm mystified
How with just one kiss he made me
Believe in angels
Though I've never seen him fly

This mornin' he walked up
Smiled and I kissed him
I never let on that he's not foolin' me
But I think it's so cute how he says
He's from Houston
I swear there's wings tucked up his sleeves

Though I've never seen him fly
On the wings of love he carries me
Heaven bound I'm mystified
How with just one kiss he made me
Believe in angels
Though I've never seen him fly

Heaven bound I'm mystified
How with just one kiss he made me
Believe in angels
Though I've never seen him fly
