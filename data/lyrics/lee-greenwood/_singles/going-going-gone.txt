It's over; I left the door unlocked again
But this time someone new walked in
When she was all alone
He told her that there was much more life to see
Than she would ever see with me
Now she's going, going, gone

It's over; I never thought I'd see this day
When everything would walk away
That I depended on
God, he'll hold her to make sure she don't change her mind
I've lost her all the way this time
She's going, going, gone

I should have paid attention; there were many warning signs
But I just never thought she'd walk away
Now here I stand in silence
Just the echo of the words I heard her say

She said it's over and much too late to change her mind
I've lost her all the way this time
She's going, going, gone
