We've been takin' turns starin' at each other all night
Our eyes are sayin' things, our bodies just can't deny
Now there's only one thing on my mind
It's gettin' you in these arms of mine
And once we touch baby don't you know
It won't be touch and go

It's gonna be touch and go crazy
It's gonna be touch and go out of our minds
They'll be no holdin' back in the heat of the night
When we finally touch, we're gonna ignite
Oh baby, it's gonna be touch and go crazy

In this crowded room girl it's just too risky to dance
'Cause once I'm holding you, this thing could get outta hand
There's no controllin' feelings this strong
We've gotta go where we're all alone
'Cause once we touch baby we both know
It won't be touch and go

It's gonna be touch and go crazy
It's gonna be touch and go out of our minds
They'll be no holdin' back in the heat of the night
When we finally touch, we're gonna ignite
Oh baby, it's gonna be touch and go crazy

O it won't be touch and go

It's gonna be touch and go crazy
It's gonna be touch and go out of our minds
They'll be no holdin' back in the heat of the night
When we finally touch, we're gonna ignite
Oh baby, it's gonna be touch and go crazy
