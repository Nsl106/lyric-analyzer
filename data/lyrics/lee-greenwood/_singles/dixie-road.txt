I would pick and we would sing to the rhythm of that front porch swing
The moonlight holds the spotlight that we shared
I found new notes on that old guitar, she believed I could be a star
She told me that she wanted to be fair

She said, I love you more than to hold you down, boy you're glory bound
We can't share a world with different dreams
So I chased mine and she found hers too, but someone else made hers come true
Now I'm a star, but every time I sing

My heart goes drifting down a dusty dixie road
Taking my mind, back in time
L.A. lights burn like hell once you know
You left heaven waitin' down the dixie road

Every night I'm in a different place and I'm searching every stranger's face
Trying to find the girl that's just not there
She's back there in Montegomery and I'm clear across the country
But whenever I'm alone I go back there

My heart goes drifting down a dusty dixie road
Taking my mind, back in time
L.A. lights burn like hell once you know
You left heaven waitin' down the dixie road

My heart goes drifting down a dusty dixie road
Taking my mind, back in time
L.A. lights burn like hell once you know
You left heaven waitin' down the dixie road
