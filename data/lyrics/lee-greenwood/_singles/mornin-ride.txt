There's a quiet time in the early dawn
Before the mornin' paper, before the coffee's on
When there ain't much movin' in the world outside
Oh I'd love to take a mornin' ride
My baby knows it's the time we share
She wakes me gently, brushes back her hair
And she moves into my arms sweet and slow
I can't wait to get up and go
Gonna take my baby on a mornin' ride
When the sun comes slippin' 'round the mountainside
'Bout an hour, maybe two
Ain't nothin' me and her would rather do
Than see the green grass glist'nin' in the mornin' dew
While the world's still damn spankin' new
Oh I know how beautiful the day will be
When she takes a mornin' ride with me
And when we get back, it will feel so right
To just lay back and linger in the mornin' light
Then she'll smile at me, thinkin' where we've been
Wantin' me to take her again
I'm gonna take my baby on a mornin' ride
When the sun comes slippin' 'round the mountainside
For an hour, maybe two
Ain't nothin' me and her would rather do
Than see the green grass glist'nin' in the mornin' dew
While the world's still damn spankin' new
Oh I know how beautiful the day will be
When she takes a mornin' ride with me
Oh I'm gonna take my baby on a mornin' ride
When the sun comes slippin' 'round the mountainside
'Bout an hour, maybe two
Ain't nothin' me and her would rather do
