My world's a roller-coaster and my life's a traffic jam
All this mess ain't even close to bein' who I am
I've been dreamin' Carolina, catchin' craw-dads by the creek
But I'm stuck here in this prison cell full of city streets
I need a little time, I need a little space
I need a little gone, a little out of this place
I wanna get back where I can breathe
Where I feel free, yeah
Take me back, I've been away too long
Take me back to my home sweet home
I can smell my mama's cookin'
And the sweet magnolia trees
Nothing like suppertime on a summer night
I can hear those crickets callin' me
I need a little time, I need a little space
I need a little gone, a little out of this place
I wanna get back where I can breathe
Where I feel free, yeah
Take me back, I've been away too long
Take me back to my home sweet home
I need a little time, I need a little space
I need a little gone, a little out of this place
I wanna get back where I can breathe
Where I feel free, yeah
Take me back, I've been away too long
Take me back, I've been away too long
Take me back, I've been away too long
Take me back to my home sweet home
Kissin' Jenny Lynn on a front porch swing
Catchin' fireflies on the first day of spring
Swingin' along while the church choir sings
Sneakin' around on a full moon night
Makin' out for the very first time
Those were the best days of my life
