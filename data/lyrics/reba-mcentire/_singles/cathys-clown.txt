[Chorus]
I want your loving more and more
I want your kisses that's for sure
I die each time
I hear the sound
They're saying here he comes
He's Cathy's Clown

[Verse 1]
You know you've got to stand tall
You know a man can't crawl
And when you let her tell you lies
And you let them pass you by
You're not a man at all

[Verse 2]
She doesn't want your loving anymore
She doesn't want your kisses that's for sure
Why do you let them put you down
And let them call you Cathy's Clown

[Verse 3]
When you see me shed a tear
Then you know that I'm sincere
I just think it's kind of sad
That she's treating you so bad
And I'm the one who cares

[Chorus]
I want your loving more and more
I want your kisses that's for sure
I die each time
I hear the sound
They're saying here he comes
He's Cathy's Clown

[Outro]
You're Cathy's Clown
You're Cathy's Clown
