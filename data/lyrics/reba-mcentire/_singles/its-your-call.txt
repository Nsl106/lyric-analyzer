[Verse 1]
It's your call, it's her
Would you rather take it in the other room
She's hanging on and so am I
Yeah, I know all about it, don't act so surprised
It's time to end this game you're playing
She's not the only one who's waiting on the line

[Verse 2]
It's your call
It's up to you
And I won't try to stop you if you go
But if you stay tell her goodbye
I can't take another minute
I can't stand another night

[Chorus]
Of wondering if I even matter
It's something only you can answer
Here's the phone, it's your call

[Bridge]
There's no easy way out this time
Because I won't live this way
She called here to talk to you
With a message that I can't take

[Chorus]
Oh I got to know if I still matter
It's something only you can answer
Here's the phone, it's your call
