[Verse 1]
You sure know what you're doing
Holding me this way
And I'll go where you lead me
Anywhere you say
You've got me where you want me
So darling, please be kind
Before you take it all
And I make that final fall
You've got to keep in mind

[Chorus]
I'm a new fool at an old game
A kid out of school trying to find my way
But I don't know the rules, teach me how to play
I'm just a new fool at an old game

[Verse 2]
Well, maybe I'm a dreamer
Or maybe I'm naive
But when you say you love me
I start to believe
That coal can turn to diamonds
And this night will never end
But if it isn't so and I cry when you go
You've got to understand

[Chorus]
I'm a new fool at an old game
A kid out of school trying to find my way
But I don't know the rules, teach me how to play
I'm just a new fool at an old game
