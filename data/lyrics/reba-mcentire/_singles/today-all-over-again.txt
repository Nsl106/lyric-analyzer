[Chorus]
Is this how it is when it's over
Between a woman and man?
Must tomorrow just keep on bein'
Today all over again?

[Verse 1]
You made it look so easy
Fallin' for somebody new
But I must be going about it all wrong
For I just can't stop loving you

[Chorus]
Is this how it is when it's over
Between a woman and man?
Must tomorrow just keep on bein'
Today all over again?

[Verse 2]
This mornin', I reached out to touch you
A habit I've held for so long
But I just started hurtin' all over again
Like I have ever since you've been gone

[Chorus]
Is this how it is when it's over
Between a woman and man?
Must tomorrow just keep on bein'
Today all over again?
Today all over again
