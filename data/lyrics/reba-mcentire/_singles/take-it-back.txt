[Verse 1]
You talked me into moving in and giving you my key
You said you'd be a mess now if it hadn't been for me
You said I stole your heart away by looking in your eyes
I wonder now, how many times you sold that pack of lies

[Chorus]
If this is how you act when you give your heart away
Well, take it back
Take it back

[Verse 2]
You told me I was everything you wanted and more
Then tell me what you're doing now sneaking out the back door
You're bringing home flowers and a bottle of Chablis
You forgot I don't drink wine I know that bottle's not for me

[Chorus]
If this is how you act when you give your heart away
Well, take it back
Take it back

[Verse 3]
Oh, you must think I'm blind
And I don't smell your new cologne
You don't think I notice
All the nights I spend alone

[Verse 4]
Well, I'm not one for sitting around in some old pity pool
You think you got a ticket and I must be some kind of fool
I hate to steal your thunder but your playing days are through
At least they are for me because babe, I got no use for you

Tonight laying on the street
Babe, your bag is packed
So, take it back

[Verse 3]
Oh, you must think I'm blind
And I don't smell your new cologne
You don't think I notice
All the nights I spend alone

[Verse 4]
Well, I'm not one for sitting around in some old pity pool
You think you got a ticket and I must be some kind of fool
I hate to steal your thunder but your playing days are through
At least they are for me because babe, I got no use for you

[Outro]
Tonight laying on the street
Babe, your bag is packed
So, take it back
