She came in looking good and looking around
She's checking out every man in the room right now
Now don't go telling her about right or wrong
She's been alone way too long

And the heart is a lonely hunter
With only one desire
To find some lasting comfort
In the arms of a lover's fire
Driven by a desperate hunger
To the dark of the neon lights
Oh the heart is a lonely hunter
When there's no sign of a love in sight

She hears him say- "Hey can I buy you a drink"
Then sees the pale white circle where he wears his ring
She knows that he is dealing her a dangerous hand
The consequences of a one night stand

But the heart is a lonely hunter
With only one desire
To find some lasting comfort
In the arms of a lover's fire
Driven by a desperate hunger
To the dark of the neon lights
Oh the heart is a lonely hunter
When there's no sign of a love in sight

From somewhere deep inside she tells him "no"
Before she starts to cry she turns to go

Cuz the heart is a lonely hunter
With only one desire
To find some lasting comfort
In the arms of a lover's fire
Driven by a desperate hunger
To the dark of the neon lights
Oh the heart is a lonely hunter
When there's no sign of a love in sight
