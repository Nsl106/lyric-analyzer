[Verse 1]
He says he loves her, what can you say to that
He's made up his mind and there isn't nothing you can do
And as you swallow hard, maybe you drive all night
Trying to figure out where the whole thing started going wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
And in the silence something begins to unravel
You never knew him like you'll be knowing him now

[Chorus]
Falling out of love and back into your life
Pulling your heart out from under the knife
Closing the door on all those dreams you used to know
Falling out of love and back on your feet
Turning away from that dead end street
Finding out that nothing feels as good as letting go

[Verse 2]
That's when he called you up out of the blue one day
And you know he thinks he's talking to the girl you used to be
So when you tell him he's just a memory
Isn't it funny how his voice cracks when you're saying goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh and nothing feels as good as letting go
He said he loved her
