[Verse 1]
Oh, isn't life wonderful
When everything is right
But sometimes wonderful
Can fall apart sometimes
When your troubles knock you down
Pick yourself up off the ground and

[Chorus]
Walk on
Walk on
Nothing ever stays wrong that long
Walk on
Oh, walk on
Don't just stand there in the storm
Walk toward the light until you find the sun
And you'll be better off in the long run
And walk on

[Verse 2]
Oh, it's a heartache when love comes to an end
But even though your heart breaks
You know it's going to mend
Keep the faith right through goodbye
And don't you ever break your stride

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Walk on [x5]
