[Verse 1]
My world revolved around you
Every word was a promise I was hanging on
Swept up inside a whirlwind
I just couldn't see the end until you were gone
I thought I would fall apart
With shattered dreams and a broken heart
Scrambling in the dark

[Chorus]
How was I to know
That I'd be OK
Thought I'd lose it all when you walked away
How was I to know
I would be this strong
I had what it takes all along
How was I to know

[Verse 2]
What I was so afraid of
Turned out to be my freedom in disguise
Now I know what I'm made of
Guess it just took some time to realize
I was blind I couldn't tell
Put too much faith in someone else
Gave up on myself

[Chorus][x2]
