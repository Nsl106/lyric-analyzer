[Verse 1]
My cousin's getting married at the Methodist church
That's why I stayed home from work
I'm supposed to hold the flowers
When the new bride kisses the groom
That's what I'm supposed to do
So what are we doing with the windows rolled down
Twenty five passionate miles from town
I love her like a sister baby but to tell the truth

[Chorus]
I'd rather ride around with you

[Verse 2]
The guy she's going to marry has got money to burn
His daddy's a partner in some big law firm
Yeah that's how they're going
To Hawaii on their honeymoon
First class to Honolulu
She's never even set foot on a jet
I'm a little bit jealous I confess
I'd like to fly to Hawaii
But honey, if I had to choose

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I don't care where this road goes
No, I don't want to turn around
Let go of the wheel, feel the wind blow
Don't even think about slowing down

They're tying tin cans to the back of the car
Wondering where in the world we are
The preacher's done praying
And the couple's done saying I do
That could be me and you
There's way too many decisions to make
The length of the dress
The layers on the cake
One of these days I might get married too

[Chorus][x3]
