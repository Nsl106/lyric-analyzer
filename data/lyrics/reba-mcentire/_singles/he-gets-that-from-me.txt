[Verse 1]
His early morning attitude
You have to drag him out of bed
Only frosted flakes will do

[Hook 1]
He gets that from me
Yeah, he gets that from me

[Verse 2]
His curly hair and his knobby knees
The way the sun brings those freckles out
Talk and talk and never miss a beat

[Hook 1]
Yeah, he gets that from me
He gets that from me

[Chorus 1]
He looks at me with those big brown eyes
He's got me in the palm of his hands
And I swear sometimes
It's just like you're here again
He smiles that little crooked smile
There's no denying he's your child
Without him, I don't know what I'd do

[Hook 2]
He gets that from you
Oh, he gets that from you

[Chorus 2]
How he loves your old guitar
Yeah, he's taught himself to play
He melts my heart
Tells me he loves me every day
And cracks a joke at the perfect time
Makes me laugh when I want to cry
That boy is everything to me

[Hook 2]
He gets that from you
He gets that from you

[Verse 3]
Last night I heard him pray
"Lord, help me and Momma make it through
And tell Daddy we'll be okay"

[Hook 3]
He said he sure misses you
He sure misses you
He really misses you
He gets that from me
