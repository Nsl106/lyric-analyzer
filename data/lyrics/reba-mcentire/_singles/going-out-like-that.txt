[Verse 1]
It's been awhile since she put that red dress on
And slipped into those high heels
She's got a couple of new guys blowing up her phone
And she loves the way that that feels
You'd never know she was going through a break up
There ain't a single tear messing up her make up

[Chorus]
He thought she'd be sitting home crying
But she ain't goin' out like that
She's had enough of feeling like dying
She ain't goin' out like that
Everybody, here comes the life of the party, yeah, she is
He might have left her brokenhearted
But she ain't goin' goin out like that

[Verse 2]
She's got her hands up dancin' like the floor's on fire
Yeah she's the hottest thing in here
Guess she finally got tired of being sick and tired
Now she's lookin like she don't care
If she was hurting, well she must've forgot
She's smiling while she's throwing back shots

[Chorus]
He thought she'd be sitting home crying
But she ain't goin' out like that
She's had enough of feeling like dying
She ain't goin' out like that
Everybody, here comes the life of the party, yeah, she is
He might have left her brokenhearted
But she ain't goin' goin out like that

[Chorus]
He thought she'd be sitting home crying
But she ain't goin' out like that
She's had enough of feeling like dying
She ain't goin' out like that
Everybody, here comes the life of the party, yeah, she is
He might have left her brokenhearted
But she ain't goin' goin out like that


[Outro]
Everybody, here comes the life of the party
Everybody, here comes the life of the party, yeah, she is
