When I heard that familiar voice
My heart stopped dead in its tracks
Across the room
I could see him there
A ghost from my past
But he's too caught up to notice me
She must be his new love
I never dreamed that it would hurt this much
It's just

I know how he feels
How warm his touch is
Oh, how he feels
How soft his kiss is
And it cuts right down to the bone
Because I let him go
I know how he cares
How strong his love can be
When he believes its real
Oh, I've been there
I know how he feels

As long as I kept him out of sight
I kept from going out of my mind
Tried to believe
That leaving him was somehow justified
But tonight there's no denying
What a love like his is worth
He once looked at me
The way he's looking at her
What a lucky girl

I know how he feels
How warm his touch is
Oh, how he feels
How soft his kiss is
And it cuts right down to the bone
Because I let him go
I know how he cares
How strong his love can be
When he believes its real
Oh, I've been there
I know how he feels

And it's killing me
Oh, I know how he feels
