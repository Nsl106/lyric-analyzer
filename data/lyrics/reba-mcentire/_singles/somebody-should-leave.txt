[Verse 1]
It sure gets quiet
When the kids go to bed
We lay here in the silence
Putting off what must be said

[Verse 2]
I read a book, you watch T.V
As our love dies quietly
I'm so sad
I don't know what I've just read

[Chorus]
Somebody should leave
But which one should it be
You need the kids and they need me
Somebody should leave
But we hate to give in
We keep hoping somehow
We might need each other again

[Verse 3]
You say goodnight
And turn and face the wall
We lie here in the darkness
And the tears start to fall

[Verse 4]
If it's only you and me
Goodbye might come more easily
But what about
Those babies down the hall

[Chorus]
Somebody should leave
But which one should it be
You need the kids and they need me
Somebody should leave
But we hate to give in
We keep hoping somehow
We might need each other again
