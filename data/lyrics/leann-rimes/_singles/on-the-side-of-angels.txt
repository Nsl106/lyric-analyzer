[Verse 1]
I've never been so certain
I've never been so sure
We're on the side of angels
If we believe this love is pure
Is it so hard to trust it
'Cause we've been wrong before?
There comes a time in every life
We find the heart we're waitin' for

[Chorus]
After all the might-have-beens
The close and distant calls
After all the try-agains
Don't be afraid to fall
We're on the side of angels after all

[Verse 2]
Every time you touch me
Don't you feel it too?
The gentle hand that's guiding us
You to me, me to you

[Chorus]
After all the might-have-beens
The close and distant calls
After all the try-agains
Don't be afraid to fall
We're on the side of angels after all

[Bridge]
Heaven only knows
Why this took so long
But only Heaven knows
A love is right or wrong

[Chorus]
After all the might-have-beens
The close and distant calls
After all the try-agains
Don't be afraid to fall
We're on the side of angels
On the side of angels
On the side of angels after all

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah
On the side of angels
Ooh
