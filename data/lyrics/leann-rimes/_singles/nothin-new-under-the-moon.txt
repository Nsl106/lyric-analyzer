[Verse 1]
Nowhere to go
All night to get there
Another nice try with Mr. Wrong
Late night TV on my horizon
National Anthem and I'm barely hanging on
Just a typical Saturday night
Feeling like the rest of my life

[Chorus]
There was nothing new under the moon
Same old dance
Same old tune
Just wishes on stars that never came true
Just one more night to get through
But there was nothing new under the moon 'til you

[Verse 2]
Hey, what a change
Hey, what a concept
Here's a true heart wanting mine
News flash!
Who'd ever thought you could
Have the same feeling at the very same time?
Look at what your love's doing to me
I can't believe I used to believe

[Chorus]
There was nothing new under the moon
Same old dance
Same old tune
Just wishes on stars that never came true
Just one more night to get through
But there was nothing new under the moon 'til you
There was nothing new under the moon
Same old dance
Same old tune
Just wishes on stars that never came true
Just one more night to get through
But there was nothing new under the moon 'til you
There was nothing new under the moon
Same old dance
Same old tune
Just wishes on stars that never came true
Just one more night to get through
But there was nothing new under the moon 'til you
