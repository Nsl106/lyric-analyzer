[Verse 1]
What I'm lookin' for
Is a love that's forever
Someone who can capture my soul in a heartbeat
And stay for all time
What I'm prayin' for
Is a match made in Heaven
Someone who will worship my body
And still put his heart on the line

[Chorus]
Commitment
Someone who'll go the distance
I need somebody with staying power
Who will make me go weak in the knees
Commitment
And everything that goes with it
I need honor and love in my life from somebody
Who's playin' for keeps

[Verse 2]
What I'm searching for
Is a man who'll stand by me
Who will walk through the fire
And be my flame in the night
I won't settle for less
Than what I deserve
A friend and a lover who'll love me
For the rest of my life

[Chorus]
Commitment
Someone who'll go the distance
I need somebody with staying power
Who will make me go weak in the knees
Commitment
And everything that goes with it
I need honor and love in my life from somebody
Who's playin' for keeps

[Bridge]
Yeah, I've had promises broken
Three words left unspoken
They just left me achin' for more
But I've found temptation
I won't be impatient
There's one thing that's worth waitin' for

[Chorus]
Commitment
Someone who'll go the distance
I need somebody with staying power
Who will make me go weak in the knees
Commitment
And everything that goes with it
I need honor and love in my life from somebody
Who's playin' for keeps
