[Verse 1]
Life can take your dreams
And turn them upside down
Friends will talk about you
When you're not around
Reality can really cut you down to size
But don't ever lose that light in your eyes
Don't ever lose that light in your eyes
People make you promises they'll never keep
Soon you'll know why people say talk is cheap
And life resembles one big compromise
But don't ever lose that light in your eyes

[Chorus]
Keep on shining
Keep on smiling
Don't lose faith and don't lose heart
When you're crying
Just keep trying to remind yourself
You're a shining star
Yes, you are

[Verse 2]
Somewhere down the line
You'll face the judgment day
When the angels look at you
What will you say?
They've got a way of knowing who qualifies
Just let 'em see that light in your eyes
Don't ever lose that light in your eyes

[Chorus]
Keep on shining
Keep on smiling
Don't lose faith and don't lose heart
When you're crying
Just keep trying to remind yourself
You're a shining star
Yes, you are

[Outro]
Don't ever lose that light in your eyes
Don't ever lose that light in your eyes
Don't ever lose
