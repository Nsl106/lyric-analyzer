Got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend
Took his ring off my finger, gave him back his last name
So don't judge me, I'm doing the best I can
Got a damn good reason for this drink in my hand
Got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend

No, I didn't see it coming, she was sly as could be
I was crying on her shoulder, he was cheating on me
She never let on that it was her stealing his love
But I wised up

I got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend
Good riddance to 'em both, I really don't need them
I was working two jobs, they were fooling around
Crossed my mind to put 'em six feet in the ground
I got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend

Trust may be something that I live without
It's gonna take a while to remove my doubt
But everyone around you at some point will let you down
That's how I feel now

I got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend
I got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend

Now I heard it through the grapevine, he's tired of her
Guess they're finally getting what they deserve
The last time I saw him, he had the nerve to hit on me
How sleazy can you be?

I got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend
Took his ring off my finger, gave him back his last name
So don't judge me, I'm doing the best I can
I've got a damn good reason for this drink in my hand

Got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend
I got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend
