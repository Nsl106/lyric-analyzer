[Verse 1]
Ever since I met you, girl, you been on my brain
I can't think of nothin' else but you all night and day
It's like I got a first-class seat up on Ozzy's train
And it's drivin' me insane

[Chorus]
5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po
I'm goin' crazy thinkin' 'bout you, baby
5-1-5-0, just this side of loco
I'm goin' crazy, think I love you, baby

[Verse 2]
I gotta get your number, girl, I gotta call you up
I gotta get you ridin' shotgun in my truck
This little bit of you I've got, it ain't good enough
Yeah, you got me all messed up

[Chorus]
5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po
I'm goin' crazy thinkin' 'bout you, baby
5-1-5-0, just this side of loco
I'm goin' crazy, think I love you, baby

[Verse 3]
'Cause I ain't never felt like this, naw
And I, I just need one kiss from you
And I'll be good as new
If I don't get some of your sweet lovin' no tellin' what I might do, oh

[Bridge]
5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po, mm
Think I'm losin' my mind, girl
5-1-5-0, just this side of loco
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po
I'm goin' crazy thinkin' 'bout you, baby
5-1-5-0, spinnin' my head like a yoyo
I'm goin' crazy, I think I love you, baby
