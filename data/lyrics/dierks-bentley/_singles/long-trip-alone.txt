[Verse 1]
It's a long trip alone over sand and snows
That lie along the road that we all must travel down

[Chorus]
So maybe you could walk with me a while
And maybe I could rest beneath your smile
Everybody stumbles sometimes and needs a hand to hold
'Cause it's a long trip alone

[Verse 2]
It's a short piece of time, but just enough to find
A little peace of mind under the sun somewhere

[Chorus]
So maybe you could walk with me a while
And maybe I could rest beneath your smile
You know we can't afford to let one moment pass us by
'Cause it's a short piece of time

[Verse 3]
And I don't know where I'd be without you here
'Cause I'm not really me without you there

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, oh

[Outro]
So maybe you could walk with me a while
And maybe I could rest beneath your smile
Everybody stumbles sometimes and needs a hand to hold
So maybe you could walk with me a while
And maybe I could rest beneath your smile
And maybe I could feel you right beside me 'til I'm home
'Cause it's a long trip alone
A long trip alone
