[Verse 1]
Lay your pretty head down on my shoulder
You don’t have to worry anymore
This old world is cold and getting colder
And I know how to lock and bolt the door
I’m strong enough to hold you through the winter
Mean enough to stare your demons down
The hard times put the shine into the diamond
I won’t let that keep us in the ground

[Chorus]
I'm a riser
I'm a get up off the ground, don't run and hider
Pushing comes to shove
Hey, I'm a fighter
When darkness comes to town, I'm a lighter
A get out aliver of the fire
Survivor

[Verse 2]
If we ain't got no money, I can make it
And I ain't afraid of working to the bone
When I don’t know what I'm doing, I can fake it
I'll pray 'til jesus rolls away the stone

[Chorus]
I'm a riser
I'm a get up off the ground, don't run and hider
Pushing comes to shove
Hey, I'm a fighter
When darkness comes to town, I'm a lighter
A get out aliver of the fire
Survivor

[Bridge]
I'm a trier
I'm a get down low so I can lift you higher
An army couldn’t keep down my desire
Yeah

[Chorus]
I'm a riser
I'm a get up off the ground, don't run and hider
Pushing comes to shove
Hey, I'm a fighter
When darkness comes to town, I'm a lighter
A get out aliver of the fire
Survivor

[Outro]
I’m a riser
I’m a riser
I’m a riser
I’m a riser
