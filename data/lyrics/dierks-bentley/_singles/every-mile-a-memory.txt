[Verse 1]
Country roads, old theater marquee signs
Parking lots and billboards flying by
Spanish moss, little hick town squares
Wild roses on a river bank, girl, it's almost like you're there, oh

[Chorus]
Every mile, a memory, every song, another scene
From some old movie going back in time, you and me
Every day, a page turned down, every night, a lonesome sound
Like a freight train rolling through my dreams
Every mile, a memory

[Verse 2]
Red sun down out across the western sky
Takes me back to the fire in your eyes
Texas stars in a purple night
Not seeing 'em with you, baby, oh, they never do them right, no

[Chorus]
Every mile, a memory, every song, another scene
From some old movie going back in time, you and me
Every day, a page turned down, every night, a lonesome sound
Like a freight train rolling through my dreams
Every mile, a memory

[Bridge]
Funny how no matter where I run
'Round every bend I only see just how far I haven't come

[Chorus]
Every mile, a memory, every song, another scene
From some old movie going back in time
Every day, a page turned down, every night, a lonesome sound
Like a freight train rolling through my dreams
Every mile, a memory

[Outro]
Every mile, a memory
Every mile, a memory
