[Chorus]
Come a little closer, baby
I feel like laying you down

[Verse 1]
On a bed of sweet surrender
Where we can work it all out
There ain't nothing that love can't fix
Girl, it's right here at our fingertips

[Chorus]
Come a little closer, baby
I feel like laying you down

[Verse 2]
Come a little closer, baby
I feel like letting go
Of everything that stands between us
And the love we used to know
I wanna touch you like a cleansing rain
Let it wash all the hurt away

[Chorus]
Come a little closer, baby
I feel like laying you down

[Bridge]
If there's still a chance
Then take my hand
And we'll steal away
Off into the night 'till we make things right
The sun’s gonna rise on a better day

[Verse 3]
Come a little closer baby
I feel like stripping it down
Back to the basics of you and me
And what makes the world go round
Every inch of you against my skin
I wanna be stronger than we've ever been

[Chorus]
Come a little closer, baby
I feel like laying you down

[Outro]
Come a little bit closer baby
Just a little bit closer baby
Come a little bit closer baby
I feel like laying you down
