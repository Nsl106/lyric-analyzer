[Verse 1]
Little children, do not worry
'cause you still got lots of time
There's no need in walking backwards
Turn around and rise and shine
If your load always seems heavy
And you're always left behind
Pick yourself up from the ground
Jump right back and rise and shine

[Chorus]
Rise and shine in the early morning
Shine your light all through the day
Makes no difference what they tell you
Stand right up and have your say
'cause the good Lord said He loved you
And through Him, your strength you'll find
Even though the world abused you
Turn around and rise and shine

[Verse 2]
Look at how they did poor Jesus
Why, they nailed Him to a cross
But He died up there on Calvary
So the world would not be lost
So don't matter how they treat you
If they slap you in the face
Just remember Jesus loves you
On the cross, He took your place

[Chorus]
Rise and shine in the early morning
Shine your light all through the day
Makes no difference how they treat you
Stand right up and have your say
'cause the good Lord said He loved you
And through Him, new strength you'll find
Even though the world abused you
Get up now, go rise and shine

[Chorus]
Rise and shine in the early morning
Shine your light all through the day
Makes no difference how they treat you
Stand right up and have your say
'cause the good Lord said He loved you
And through Him, new strength you'll find
Even though the world abused you
Get up now, go rise and shine

[Chorus]
Rise and shine in the early morning
Shine your light all through the day
Makes no difference how they treat you
Stand right up and have your say...
