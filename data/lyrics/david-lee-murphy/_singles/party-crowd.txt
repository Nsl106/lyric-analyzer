[Verse 1]
She couldn't keep from crying
When she told me goodbye
I knew Lord it was breakin' her heart
That she was breakin' mine
So for the sake of her feelings and the sake of my pride
I told her not to worry 'bout me
So I'm sittin' here soakin' up the neon lights
Misery looking for some company

[Chorus]
Tonight, I'm lookin' for a party crowd
Slammin' 'em back and laughing out loud
Where the smoke's so thick, the blues can't hang around
With the jukebox jumpin' like it just don't care
If they're dancin' over here or fightin' over there
I'm makin' the rounds, looking for a party crowd

[Verse 2]
It'll dawn on me tomorrow
Wherever I wake up
I'll look back and try to recall
Just where the heck's my truck
So take my keys and lock 'em up tight
And let the good times flow
And I'll worry 'bout tomorrow when it comes to light
The night's still young and I'm on a roll

[Chorus]
Tonight, I'm lookin' for a party crowd
Slammin' 'em back and laughing out loud
Where the smoke's so thick, the blues can't hang around
With the jukebox jumpin' like it just don't care
If they're dancin' over here or fightin' over there
I'm makin' the rounds, looking for a party crowd

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Tonight, I'm lookin' for a party crowd
Slammin' 'em back and laughing out loud
Where the smoke's so thick, the blues can't hang around
With the jukebox jumpin' like it just don't care
If they're dancin' over here or fightin' over there
I'm makin' the rounds, looking for a party crowd...
