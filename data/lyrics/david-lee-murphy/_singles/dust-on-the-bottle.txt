[Verse 1]
Creal Williams lived down a dirt road
He made homemade wine like nobody I know
I dropped by one Friday night
And said, "Can you help me, Creal?
I got a little girl waiting on me
And I want to treat her right."

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He said "I got what you need, son"
As we stepped down in the cellar
He reached through the cobwebs
As he turned on the light and said

[Chorus]
"There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool you about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time"

[Verse 2]
You were sitting in the porch swing
As I pulled up the driveway
My old heart was racing as you climbed inside
You slid over real close
As we drove down to the lake road
And watched the sun fade in that big red sky

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I reached under the front seat and said
"Now here's something special
It's just been waiting
For a night like tonight, but...

[Chorus]
"There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool you about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time"

[Bridge]
You're still with me and we've made some memories
After all these years, there's one thing I've found
Some say good love, well it's like a fine wine
It keeps getting better as the days go by

[Chorus]
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool you about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time

[Chorus]
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool you about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time

[Outro]
Don't let it fool you!
