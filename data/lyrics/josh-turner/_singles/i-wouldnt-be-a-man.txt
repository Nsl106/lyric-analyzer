[Verse 1]
There's a slow moon rising
It's shining on your skin
The way your body moves me
I know there's no holding back
No holding back

[Chorus]
I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this
I wouldn't be a man if a woman like you
Was anything I could resist
I'd have to be from another planet
Where love doesn't exist
I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this

[Verse 2]
I can feel passion flowing
As you fall into my arms
The secret way you touch me
Tells me there's no holding back
No holding back

[Chorus]
I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this
I wouldn't be a man if a woman like you
Was anything I could resist
I'd have to be from another planet
Where love doesn't exist
I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this

[Bridge]
Roll with me baby all night long
Soul to soul with me baby all night long

[Chorus]
I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this
I wouldn't be a man if a woman like you
Was anything I could resist
I'd have to be from another planet
Where love doesn't exist
I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this
