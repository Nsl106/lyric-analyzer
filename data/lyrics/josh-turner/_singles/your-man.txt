[Chorus]
Baby, lock the door, and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby, we ain't got no place to go, I hope you understand
I've been thinking about this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on just to be your man

[Verse 1]
There's no hurry, don't you worry
We can take our time
Come a little closer
Let's go over what I had in mind

[Chorus]
Baby, lock the door, and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby, we ain't got no place to go, I hope you understand
I've been thinking about this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on just to be your man

[Verse 2]
Ain't nobody ever love nobody the way that I love you
We're alone now
You don't know how long I've wanted to

[Chorus]
Baby, lock the door, and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby, we ain't got no place to go, I hope you understand
I've been thinking about this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on just to be your man

[Outro]
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man
