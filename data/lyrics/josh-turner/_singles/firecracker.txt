[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
When I look in her eyes, it ain't no surprise
Sparks start a-flying like the 4th of July
She gets me so hot, my heart starts a-poppin'
When we get to kissin', there ain't no stoppin'
When it comes to love, she ain't no slacker
My little darlin' is a firecracker

[Verse 2]
When I light the fuse, I gotta get back quick
You gotta be careful with a dynamite stick
Son of a gun, she's fun to handle
And she packs a punch like a roman candle
She's a pack of Black Cats in a red paper wrapper
My little darlin' is a firecracker

[Chorus]
We might not oughta take a roll in the hay
'Cause we'd burn the barn down one of these days
We're a match made in Heaven and it ain't no joke
But I'd sure hate to see it go up in smoke
We got a good thing goin' and it feels so right
She's a firecracker, she's the light of my life

[Verse 3]
She goes off with a great big bang (Great big bang)
Boys, I tell ya, it's a beautiful thing
She takes off, you better hang on tight
She's a blonde bottle rocket in the middle of the night
When she makes love, she's a heart attacker
My little darlin' is a firecracker

[Chorus]
We might not oughta take a roll in the hay
'Cause we'd burn the barn down one of these days
We're a match made in Heaven and it ain't no joke
But I'd sure hate to see it go up in smoke
We got a good thing goin' and it feels so right
Well, she's a firecracker, she's the light of my life

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh

[Chorus]
Yeah, we got a good thing goin' and it feels so right
Well, she's a firecracker, she's the light of my life
We got a good thing goin' and it feels so right
She's a firecracker, she's the light of my life
Well, she's a firecracker, she's the light of my life

[Outro]
Mhm
Firecracker, firecracker
Woohoo
(Firecracker, firecracker)
Bang
Mm, oh
Firecracker, firecracker
