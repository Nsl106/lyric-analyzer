[Verse 1]
There's a long black train comin' down the line
Feedin' off the souls that are lost and cryin'
Rails of sin, only evil remains
Watch out, brother, for that long black train

[Verse 2]
Look to the heavens, you can look to the skies
You can find redemption starin' back into your eyes
There is protection and there's peace the same
Burnin' your ticket for that long black train

[Chorus]
'Cause there's victory in the Lord, I say
Victory in the Lord
Cling to the Father and His Holy name
And don't go ridin' on that long black train

[Verse 3]
There's an engineer on that long black train
Makin' you wonder if the ride is worth the pain
He's just a-waitin' on your heart to say
"Let me ride on that long black train"

[Chorus]
But you know there's victory in the Lord, I say
Victory in the Lord
Cling to the Father and His Holy name
And don't go ridin' on that long black train

[Bridge]
Well, I can hear the whistle from a mile away
It sounds so good but I must stay away
That train is a beauty, makin' everybody stare
But its only destination is the middle of nowhere

[Chorus]
But you know there's victory in the Lord, I say
Victory in the Lord
Cling to the Father and His Holy name
And don't go ridin' on that long black train

[Outro]
I said cling to the Father and His Holy name
And don't go ridin' on that long black train
Yeah, watch out brother for that long black train
That devil's a-drivin' that long black train
