[Verse 1]
Do you know what it's like to be lonesome?
Do you know how it feels to be blue?
Do you still get a thrill from the dreams we used to share?
And the star that we wished upon, have you noticed, it's still there?

[Verse 2]
And if you only knew how I miss you
Miss your lips touching mine so tenderly
If you know what it's like to be lonesome
Then darling, please hurry home to me

[Verse 3]
And if you only knew how I miss you
Miss your lips touching mine so tenderly
Well, if you know what it's like to be lonesome
Then darling, plеase hurry home to me

[Outro]
Oh, darling, plеase hurry home to me
I'm so lonesome
