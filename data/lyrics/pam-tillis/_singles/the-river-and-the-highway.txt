She follows the path of least resistance
She doesn't care to see the mountain top
She twists and turns with no regard to distance
She never comes to a stop

As she rolls, she's a river
Where she goes, time will tell
Heaven knows, he can't go with her
And she rolls, all by herself
All by herself

He's headed for a single destination
He doesn't care what's standing in his path
He's a line between two points of separation
He ends just where it says to on the map

As he rolls, he's a highway
Where he goes, time will tell
Heaven knows, she can't go with him
And he rolls, all by himself
All by himself

But every now and then
He offers her a shoulder
Every now and then
She overflows
Every now and then
A bridge crosses over
It's a moment, every lover knows

As she rolls (and he rolls)
She's a river (he's a highway)
Where she goes (where he goes)
Time will tell
Heaven knows
She can't go with him (he can't go with her)
And she rolls
All by herself
And he rolls
All by himself

Fare the well...
