[Verse 1]
Looking at you through a misty moonlight
Katy did sing like a symphony
Porch swing swayin' like a Tennessee lullaby
Melody blowin' through a willow tree

[Pre-Chorus]
What was I s'posed to do
Standing there lookin' at you?
Lonely boy far from home

[Chorus]
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

[Verse 2]
Read about you in a Faulkner novel
Met you once in a Williams' play
Heard about you in a country love song
Summer night beauty took my breath away

[Pre-Chorus]
What was I s'posed to do
Standing there lookin' at you?
Lonely boy far from home

[Chorus]
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Maybe it was Memphis (Memphis)
Maybe it was southern summer nights (Southern summer nights)
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Every night now since I've been back home
I lie awake drifting in my memory
Think about you on your mama's front porch swing
Talking that way, so soft to me

[Pre-Chorus]
What was I s'posed to do
Standing there lookin' at you?
Lonely boy far from home

[Chorus]
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Maybe it was Memphis (Memphis)
Maybe it was southern summer nights (Southern summer nights)
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

[Outro]
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Oh, you know it sure felt right
Oh, maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was Memphis
But it sure felt right
