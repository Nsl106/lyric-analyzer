[Verse 1]
We tried and we tried but it's over
Guess I didn't fit the image in your mind
Now you tell me to find another lover
Oh but baby aren't you getting out of line

[Chorus]
Don't tell me what to do
You've already said we are through
I'm a page that you have turned
I'm no longer your concern
So don't tell me what to do
I'll love you forever if I want to

[Verse 2]
You're no longer in charge of my thinking
You're already in love with someone else
So if I'm into all night honkytonking
Well I'm a big girl, I can take care of myself

[Chorus]
So don't tell me what to do
You've already said we are through
I'm a page that you have turned
I'm no longer your concern
So don't tell me what to do
I'll love you forever if I want to

[Chorus]
So don't tell me what to do
You've already said we are through
I'm a page that you have turned
I'm no longer your concern
So don't tell me what to do
I'll love you forever if I want to
