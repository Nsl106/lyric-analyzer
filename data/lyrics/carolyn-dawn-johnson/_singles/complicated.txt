[Verse 1]
I'm so scared that the way that I feel is written all over my face
When you walk into the room
I wanna find a hiding place
We used to laugh
We used to hug
The way that old friends do

But now a smile
And a touch of your hand just makes me come unglued
It's such a contradiction
Do I lie or tell the truth?
Is it fact or fiction?
Oh, the way I feel for you

[Chorus]
It's so complicated
I'm so frustrated
I wanna hold you close, I wanna push you away
I wanna make you go, I wanna make you stay
Should I say it?
Should I tell you how I feel?
Oh, I want you to know, but then again I don't
It's so complicated

[Verse 2]
Just when I think I'm under control
I think I finally got a grip
Another friend tells me that my name is always on your lips
They say I'm more than just a friend
They say I must be blind
Well, I admit that I've seen you watch me
From the corner of your eye

Oh, it's so confusing
Yeah, I wish you'd just confess
But think of what I'd be losing
If your answer wasn't yes

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I hate it
Cause I've waited so long for someone like you
What do I do?
Oh, should I say it?
Should I tell you how I feel?
Oh, I want you to know, but then again I don't
It's so complicated

[Outro]
It's so complicated
It's so complicated
