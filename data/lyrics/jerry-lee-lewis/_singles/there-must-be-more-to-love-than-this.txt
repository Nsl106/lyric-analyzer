I wake up in the morning I'm still crying, yes I am
And on my lips I can taste your goodnight kiss
In my room the fragrance of your perfume lingers
And I know there must be more to love than this
I look across my lonely room and see your picture
Your loving smiling face I know I miss, yes I would darlin'
And I remebered to another you're still married
And I know there must be more to love than this

The ringing phone sounds like the doorbell to heaven, oh Lord
Your voice sounds like an angel full of bliss
But I'll go through hell tonight if I don't see you
And I know there must be more to love than this
There must be more to love than stolen moments
This love it should have brought me happiness
Ever since we started lovin' I've been hurtin' hurtin' hurtin'
And I know there must be more to love than this
Yes I know there must be more to love than this
