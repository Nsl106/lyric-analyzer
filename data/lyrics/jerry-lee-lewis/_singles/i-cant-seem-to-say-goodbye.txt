But I can't seem to say goodbye

Gone is the sunshine we knew once before
Now we're just living our lives
But when it comes time dear
To walk out the door

Well, I can't seem to say goodbye
I can say, it's all right dear
We'll make it somehow
Let me hold you, try not to cry

I can whisper I love you
Till the day that I die
But I can't seem to say goodbye

I can whisper, it's all right dear
We'll make it, make it somehow
Let me hold you, but try not to cry

I can say, it's all right dear
Till the day that I die
But I can't seem to say goodbye
