[Verse 1]
I don't mean to be guarded
I don't mean to be rude
I don't mean to just shut you out
It's just what I've been used to
My heart got calloused
I don't make that excuse
It's hard but you're worth it
I just wanna be good for you

[Chorus]
I'm a little damaged but damn you saw the good
When everyone saw baggage, you loved when no one could
Laying in this bed beside you, I don't have to hide away
You see all the wreckage
And it wrecks me that you stay

[Verse 2]
When I get lost in my own head
You always tell me the truth
And girl, you find me right where I am
You're the one thing I can't lose
Baby, you're my hero
I ain't scared to say that out loud
You're teaching me to trust again
Erasing all my doubts, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm a little damaged but damn you saw the good
When everyone saw baggage, you loved when no one could
Laying in this bed beside you, I don't have to hide away
You see all the wreckage
And it wrecks me that you stay

[Bridge]
You put all the shattered pieces back together, made them better
You saw what I could be through all the pain

[Chorus]
I'm a little damaged but damn you saw the good
When everyone saw baggage, you loved when no one could
Laying in this bed beside you, I don't have to hide away
You see all the wreckage, yeah
You see all the wreckage
It wrecks me that you stay

[Outro]
And it wrecks me that you stay
