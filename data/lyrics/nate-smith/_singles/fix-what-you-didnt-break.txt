[Verse 1]
I was a ten-year train wreck
With a last-call longneck
I was searchin', I'd been hurt real bad
Movin' on, gettin' sidetracked
One step forward and five back
Not your fault, I was scared to fall

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know why
Why you saw somethin' in me, baby
Girl, but you saw right through
All the pain, and you came and saved me

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know you didn't leave me lonely
Weren't the one that put the heartbreak on me
Picked up the pieces
It wasn't the mess that you made
Could've left me just the way you found me
But you came and put your wings around me
Girl, you went out of your way
To fix what you didn't break

[Verse 2]
You were the star in the pitch black
Shine the way on the way back
Out of nowhere, answered all my prayers
Picked up the towel that I threw in
Took in a heart that was ruined
Showed me the past ain't a tattoo
Loved me, even when you didn't have to

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know you didn't leave me lonely
Weren't the one that put the heartbreak on me
Picked up the pieces
It wasn't the mess that you made
Could've left me just the way you found me
But you came and put your wings around me
Girl, you went out of your way
To fix what you didn't break
To fix what you didn't break

[Bridge]
And I don't know why
Why you saw somethin' in me, baby
Girl, but you saw right through
All the pain, and you came and saved me

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know you didn't leave me lonely
Weren't the one that put the heartbreak on me
Picked up the pieces
It wasn't the mess that you made
Could've left me just the way you found me
But you came and put your wings around me
Girl, you went out of your way
To fix what you didn't break
To fix what you didn't break
