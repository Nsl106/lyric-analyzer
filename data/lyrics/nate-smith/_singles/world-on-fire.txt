[Verse 1]
Girl, when you called it quits
You could have done it right
You coulda left this town out of it
When you said goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
You ruined everything I love
Ripped my heart right out my chest
Girl, it's like there ain't nothing left

[Chorus]
You set my world on fire
Yeah, it's all long gone
I'm watching flames get higher
And I can't move on
I just gotta let it burn, burn, burn on down
Girl, without you it don't turn, turn, turn around
You set my world on fire
You set my world on fire

[Verse 2]
Can't hit that corner bar
Can't even ride them roads
Don't know my way around this place
I can't see through the smoke

[Pre-Chorus]
Piled up every memory
Yeah, you took the good with all the bad
Why'd you have to strike that match

[Chorus]
And set my world on fire
Yeah, it's all long gone
I'm watching flames get higher
And I can't move on
I just gotta let it burn, burn, burn on down
Girl, without you it don't turn, turn, turn around
You set my world on fire
You set my world on fire

[Bridge]
Ain't nothing left for me
In this old nothing town
Guess all we'll be is ashes on the ground
So, I watch it burn, burn, burn on down
Ain't nothing I can hold on to right now
You set my

[Chorus]
You set my world on fire
Yeah, it's all long gone
I'm watching flames get higher
And I can't move on
I just gotta let it burn, burn, burn on down
Girl, without you it don't turn, turn, turn around
You set my world on fire
You set my world on fire

[Outro]
You set my world on fire
You set my world on fire
You set my world on fire
You set my world on fire
