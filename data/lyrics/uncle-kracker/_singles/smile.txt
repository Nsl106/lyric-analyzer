[Verse 1]
You're better than the best
I'm lucky just to linger in your light
Cooler than the flip-side of my pillow, that's right
Completely unaware, nothing can compare to where you send me
It lets me know that it's okay, yeah, it's okay
And the moments when my good times start to fade

[Chorus]
You make me smile like the sun, fall out of bed
Sing like a bird, dizzy in my head
Spin like a record crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool, forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, uzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

[Verse 2]
Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack
And just like that
You steal away the rain
And just like that

[Chorus]
You make me smile like the sun, fall out of bed
Sing like a bird, dizzy in my head
Spin like a record crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool, forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

[Bridge]
Don't know how I live without you
'Cause every time that I get around you
I see the best of me inside your eyes
You make me smile

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me dance like a fool, forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild

[Chorus]
You make me smile like the sun, fall out of bed
Sing like a bird, dizzy in my head
Spin like a record crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool, forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile (Oh, you make me smile)
Oh, you make me smile (Oh, you make me smile)
Oh, you make me smile
