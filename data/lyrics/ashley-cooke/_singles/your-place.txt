[Verse 1]
My spare time and my spare key
Don't go to your front door
And I don't keep that old Jeep
In your driveway anymore
And my toothbrush ain't on your bathroom sink
Haven't been to your side of town in weeks
You're the reason this thing broke
So you should already know

[Chorus]
It ain't your place to walk up, say hey
Ask how I've been at some party
It ain't your place to ask my friends
When you see 'em out if I'm seein' somebody
You don't get to call me up 'cause you're drunk
2 a.m., say you miss us
No, you don't get to care where I'm wakin' up these days
It ain't your place

[Verse 2]
Don't reach out to my family
When the birthdays come around
And don't act like you're happy
For me when a dream works out
If I mеt someone or if I didn't
Honestly, it's nonе of your business
Anyway
'Cause at the end of the day

[Chorus]
It ain't your place to walk up, say hey
Ask how I've been at some party
It ain't your place to ask my friends
When you see 'em out if I'm seein' somebody
You don't get to call me up 'cause you're drunk
2 a.m., say you miss us
No, you don't get to care where I'm wakin' up
These days
It ain't your place

[Post-Chorus]
No, it ain't your place
No

[Bridge]
Don't say come over, don't swear that you're different
You made your bed and I ain't sleepin' in it

[Chorus]
It ain't your place to walk up, say hey
Ask how I've been at some party
It ain't your place to ask my friends
When you see 'em out if I'm seein' somebody
You don't get to call me up 'cause you're drunk
2 a.m., say you miss us
No, you don't get to care where I'm wakin' up
These days
It ain't your place

[Outro]
It ain't your place
