[Verse 1]
Her fingers feel so gentle with her hand in mine
Her hair feels like silk on my arm
Her lips tell me so tenderly she's mine alone
Until we park tonight and she goes home

[Chorus]
Borrowed angel belongs to someone else
I love my borrowed angel
I just can't help myself
That ring on her finger don't belong to me
But she loves me and I know she'll save some borrowed time for me

[Verse 2]
I wish that I could have her more than just tonight
We can't go on like this it isn't right
When that lonesome feeling comes knocking on my door
I'll call my borrowed angel to ease the pain once more

[Chorus]
Borrowed angel belongs to someone else
I love my borrowed angel
I just can't help myself
That ring on her finger don't belong to me
But she loves me and I know she'll save some borrowed time for me
But she loves me and I know she'll save some borrowed time for me
