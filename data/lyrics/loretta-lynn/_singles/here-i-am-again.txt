I told you that I'd never come around again
But here I am again, here I am again
I said I'd never let you let me down again
But here I am again, here I am

Here I am, here we are
The story's gettin' old
I know I can't hang on to you
But worse than that, I can't let go

I'm saying words I swore I'd never speak again
Like 'here I am again, here I am again'
I thought I could stay strong, but I got weak again
And here I am again, here I am

Here I am, here we are
The story's gettin' old
I know I can't hang on to you
But worse than that, I can't let go

And oh, the nights are cold
And I could use a friend
So here I am again
Here I am again
