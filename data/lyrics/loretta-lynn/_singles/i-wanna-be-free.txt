Well, I look out the window and what do I see?
The breeze is a blowing the leaves from the trees
Everything is free, everything but me

I'm gonna take this chain from around my finger
And throw her just as far as I can sling her
'Cause I wanna be free

When my baby left me, everything died
But little bluebirds are singing just outside
Singing twiddle-dee-dee, fly away with me

Well, you know I think I'm a-gonna live
Gotta lotta love left in me to give
So I wanna be free

I've released my heart, my soul, and my mind
And I'm a feeling fine
I broke the chains, the ring of gold
Before it broke my mind

Well, look who's crying and it ain't me
But I can't hardly hear and I can't half-see
Oh, I wanna be free

I've released my heart, my soul, and my mind
And I'm a feeling fine
I broke the chains, the ring of gold
Before it broke my mind

Oh, and look who's crying and it ain't me
But I can hardly hear and I can't half-see
Do I wanna be free? Did I wanna be free?
Yeah, I wanna be free, free
