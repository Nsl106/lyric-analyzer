[Verse 1]
Lying alone in this big old bed, I got you on my mind
I said when you left, I could make it by myself, but it gets harder all the time
And I can't take it no more, I see your face every time I close my eyes
So I'm going out now and I'm looking for you some winter night

[Chorus]
I want you out of my head and back in my bed before the morning sun comes up
I can't stand another night without you holding me tight, how I miss your loving touch
I'm going searching everywhere that you might be
When I find you, I'm a-bringing you home with me
I want you out of my head and back in my bed before the morning comes

[Verse 2]
Well, I might find somebody new to share my misery
But no other man can do what you can when it comes to loving me
I don't want nobody to say that I was a fool for being cool
I won't be satisfied 'til you're back in my arms and I'm loving you

[Chorus]
I want you out of my head and back in my bed before the morning sun comes up
I can't stand another night without you holding me tight, how I miss your loving touch
I'm going searching everywhere that you might be
And when I find you, I'm a-bringing you home with me
I want you out of my head and back in my bed before the morning comes
I want you out of my head and back in my bed before the morning sun comes up
I can't stand another night without you holding me tight, how I miss your loving touch
I'm going searching everywhere that you might be
When I find you, I'm a-bringing you home with me
I want you out of my head and back in my bed before the morning comes
