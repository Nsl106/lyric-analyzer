Well I'm game for just about anything
But the game you've named I ain't gonna play
You say you take a little drink
And we'll go for a ride on a star
You wanna give me a lift
But this ol' gal ain't a going that far

That happy pill you're taking
You say is a little weak
And you wanna give me one
So you say I won't go to sleep

Well your hands're a getting friendly
But I know exactly where they are
You wanna give me a lift
But this ol' gal ain't a going that far

You wanna give me a lift
But this ol' gal ain't a going that far
I'm a little bit warm
But that don't mean I'm on fire

You wanna take me for a ride
In the back seat of your car
You wanna give me a lift
But this ol' gal ain't a going that far
