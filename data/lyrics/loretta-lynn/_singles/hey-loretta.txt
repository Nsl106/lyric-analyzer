[Verse 1]
Well goodbye, tub and clothesline, goodbye, pots and pans
I'm gonna take a greyhound bus as further as I can
I ain't gonna warsh no windows and I ain't gonna scrub no floors
And when you realize I'm gone, I'm a-gonna hear you roar

[Chorus]
And you'll say, hey Loretta
I love you more than my Irish Setter
Hey Loretta, don't leave me alone
Hey Loretta, I swear I'm gonna treat you better
Buy you brand new overalls
If you'll only come back home

[Verse 2]
I work my fingers to the bone and we don't hardly speak
And all I ever get is a little kiss about once a week
So you can feed the chickens and you can milk the cow
This woman's liberation, honey, is gonna start right now

[Chorus]
And you'll say, hey Loretta
I love you more than my Irish Setter
Hey Loretta, don't leave me alone
Hey Loretta, I swear I'm gonna treat you better
Buy you brand new overalls
If you'll only come back home

[Verse 3]
I'll dress up like a movie star and pretty up my hair
And no one here is gonna know what I'll be doing there
I'll be swinging from a chandelier and bouncing off the wall
Instead of loving just one man, I'm gonna love 'em all

[Chorus]
And you'll say, hey Loretta
I love you more than my Irish Setter
Hey Loretta, don't leave me alone
Hey Loretta, I swear I'm gonna treat you better
Buy you brand new overalls
If you'll only come back home
