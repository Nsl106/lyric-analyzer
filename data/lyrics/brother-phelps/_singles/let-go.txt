[Verse 1]
Well, it's often times you let this old world get you down
And what a drag it is to know it always will
When every day you feel just a little more kicked around
'Cause the dreams you hold so long and hard get broke and not fulfilled

[Chorus]
Well then, let go, baby, let the wind blow through you hair
You can't walk around in chains and ever get nowhere
Something or someone is telling you it's over and done
Outside the free wind blows, let go

[Verse 2]
Now you're at the point that you can't really trust no one
They're all aftеr something is what you've learnеd
So you stay holed up in your room knowing that ain't fun
Cause it's bitterness and lonely left to hold you in return

[Chorus]
Well then, let go, baby, let the wind blow through you hair
You can't walk around in chains and ever get nowhere
Something or someone is telling you it's over and done
Outside the free wind blows, let go

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well now who would think that a boob tube could find such a friend
You always could tune into how it thinks
Honey, the loving cup you need is a movie's tragic end
Always knocked over and spilled as you're reaching for a drink

[Chorus]
Well then, let go, baby, let the wind blow through you hair
You can't walk around in chains and ever get nowhere
Something or someone is telling you it's over and done
Outside the free wind blows, let go

[Tag]
Well then, let go, baby, let the wind blow through you hair
Let go...
