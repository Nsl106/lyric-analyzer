[Verse 1]
I thought by now I'd have it figured out
How not to make the easy thing so hard to do
I bet that I'd be further down this road
If I could read the signs that point me to the truth

[Verse 2]
I never planned on being nothin' but a cowboy
But somewhere I picked up this old guitar
Girl, all I can say is that I'm sorry
If I get kinda careless with your heart

[Chorus]
All the headlights, all the midnights
Chasin' all that empty, still ain't got it right
All the crazy all the gypsy
I guess all I'm sayin' is forgive me
If I don't know what I'm doin'
I'm still learnin' to be human

[Verse 3]
So far I've been good at burnin' bridges
Strike a match and ride right out of town
Bless your heart for nevеr tryin' to fix me
Or quit me or slow me down

[Chorus]
All thе headlights, all the midnights
Chasin' all that empty, still ain't got it right
All the crazy all the gypsy
I guess all I'm sayin' is forgive me
If I don't know what I'm doin'
'Cause I'm still learnin' to be human

[Chorus]
All the highways playin' outlaw
Rollin' outta nowhere with the brakes off
All the crazy and the whiskey
Wakin' up and wonderin' what hit me
Whoa, forgive me, I really don't know what I'm doin'
'Cause I'm still learnin' to be human
Mm, still learnin' to be human
