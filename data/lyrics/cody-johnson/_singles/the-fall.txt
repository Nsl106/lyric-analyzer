[Verse 1]
I've been good-time drunk
Enough to be bad-time sober
Broke a map dot's heart when it disappeared over my shoulder
I've been headstrong, rightin' dead end wrong
Good with God, but I dropped the ball
Spent my whole life holdin' on
But even when I fell off

[Chorus]
The ride was worth the fall
The fall was worth the smiles
The smiles were worth the tears
Tears were worth the miles
Milеs were worth the pain
Pain was worth it all
It's all worth this lifе
The life is worth the ride
The ride is worth the fall

[Verse 2]
Had some "nowhere near it's"
And some "almost was's"
Left some mommas in tears
And some daddy's still cussin'
'Cause what I shoulda done and what I coulda been
Even knowin' now what I didn't know, then
I'd climb back on again

[Chorus]
The ride is worth the fall
The fall was worth the smiles
The smiles were worth the tears
Tears were worth the miles
Miles were worth the pain
Pain was worth it all
It's all worth this life
The life is worth the ride
The ride is worth the fall

[Chorus]
The ride was worth the fall
The fall was worth the smiles
The smiles were worth the tears
Tears were worth the miles
Miles were worth the pain
Pain was worth it all
It's all worth this life
Life is worth the ride
The ride is worth the fall
