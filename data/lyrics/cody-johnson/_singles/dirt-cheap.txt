[Verse 1]
They came in thinkin' top dollar
To that old cotton crop farmer
They knocked on his screen door and he said
"Lord, what you need, boys?" And they said
"You know all the others went and cashed out
We got the subdivision all mapped out
It'll sit right here on this land
And you could leave town a rich man"
And he said, "Boys, whatever you're offerin', it won't be enough

[Chorus]
'Cause I got a little girl that used to swing right there
I still see her pink bow in her brown hair
She's in the big city, but she still calls home
What's she gonna do if she comes back and we're gone?
And ovеr there, under that whitе oak tree
Beneath the cross is where my best buddy's buried
Lasted thirteen huntin' seasons runnin' strong
Keep your money 'cause a man can't leave his dog
And over there is where I got down on one knee
You can't buy that kind of dirt cheap"

[Verse 2]
One man smiled and he kinda looked away
The other said, "Before we go, I gotta know one thing
Between the droughts and the floods through all the years
What in the world got you through?
How the hell'd you get here?" And he said

[Chorus]
"That little girl that used to swing right there
I still see her pink bow in her brown hair
Runnin' up after one of them long days
A big smile makin' every little worry fade
And over there, under that white oak tree
Beneath the cross, where my best buddy's buried
All them huntin' seasons freezin' in a jon boat
Me and him, double-barrel and a two-stroke
And that woman that said 'yes' when I got down on one knee
Yeah, you can't buy that kind of dirt cheap

[Bridge]
No, it ain't somethin' you fall into
It's somethin' God gives you
And you hold on to

[Chorus]
Just like that little girl who used to swing right there
I still see her pink bow in her brown hair
She's in the big city now, but she still calls home
She's comin' back next week and, man, it's been too long
And over there, under that white oak tree
Beside the cross, where my best buddy's buried
Lays a puppy posted up in the shade
That woman never could turn away a stray
I guess that's why she said 'yes' when I got down on one knee
Oh, long as all this is here, why the hell would I ever leave?
You can't buy that kind of dirt cheap"
