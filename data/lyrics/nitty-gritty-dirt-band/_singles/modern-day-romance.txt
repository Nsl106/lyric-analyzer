[Verse 1]
We met on the highway, she flagged me down
Had a flat on her Stingray with nobody around
So I helped her out, she said, "Climb in"
So I ditched my old truck just to see where the party would end

[Verse 2]
We spent the weekend in Reno in a honeymoon suite
Never saw the casino, barely took time to eat
I never dreamed she would take me this far
But by Sunday, that lady had taken a hold of my heart

[Chorus]
It's a modern day romance, a new kind of game
With no time to slow dance in the fast lane
I tried to love her without any strings
But a modern day romance has left me some old-fashioned pain

[Verse 3]
She never said, "Good-bye," just a note by the phone
Said, "Thanks for the good times, but it's time to move on"
Well, I'm out here walkin' with my thumb in the air
And wondering where she might've gone and why I even care

[Chorus]
It's just a modern day romance, a new kind of game
With no time to slow dance in the fast lane
I tried to love her without any strings
But a modern day romance has left me some old-fashioned pain

[Outro]
It's a modern day romance, old fashioned pain
