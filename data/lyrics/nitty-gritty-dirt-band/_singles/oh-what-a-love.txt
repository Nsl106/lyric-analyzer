[Chorus]
Oh what a love
That'll bind the wounds of a loss
And heal my heart
Oh what a love
To cast away the pain
Oh what a love
That'll bear for me
The cost of a brand new start
Oh what a love
To let me begin again

[Verse 1]
Oh what a life
That'll brighten up
The corners of a lonely life
Oh what a life
To cast away the rain
Oh what a life
To remove the gloom
I face in the dark alone
Oh what a life
I believe I can see again

[Bridge]
I remember the day
We walked on the beach 'til sunset
Then we sang
And the songs we played
Were a promise of love
That'll last beyond the grave

[Verse 2]
Oh what a song
Learned from the sea
Taught solely to the young
Oh what a song
To cast away the rain
Oh what a song
To break the bonds of fear
And still the sound
Oh what a song
I believe I can sing again

[Bridge]
I remember the day
We met at a place of hope
I took what you gave
And the words we'd say
Were a promise of love
That I'll honor beyond the grave

[Chorus]
Oh what a love
That'll bind the wounds of a loss
And heal my heart
Oh what a love
To cast away the pain
Oh what a love
That'll bear for me
The cost of a brand new start
Oh what a love
To let me begin again

[Outro]
Oh what a love
Oh what a life
Oh what a song
