Sittin' alone in the dark
Wastin' my time in a park
'Cause I've got
Nowhere to go

Had me a job 'til the market fell out
Tried hard to borrow but there was no help
Now I've got
Nowhere to go

I need a job for these two hands
I'm a workin' man
With nowhere to go

One last look at my land
Auctioneer with his gavel in hand
And he says, "It's got to go"

Worked this piece all my life
It broke my heart and it took my wife
Now I've got nothing to show

I need a job for these two hands
I'm a workin' man
With nowhere to go

Wandered aimless in the city
With my dirt workin' boots
And my old straw hat in hand

Singing a song by Woody Guthrie
This land is your land
It ain't my land

I'm a workin' man
With nowhere to go

I was born to the sunrise
Breaking back all day
Now I've got
Something to say

I am broke but not broken
And I am not alone
'Cause there's a lot of folks
With nowhere to go

Are they ever gonna understand
You can't leave a workin' man
Nowhere to go

Are they ever gonna understand
You can't leave a workin' man
Nowhere to go

Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
