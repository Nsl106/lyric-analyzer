[Intro: Jessie Murph]
Hm-mm, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Jessie Murph]
Got me wide, wide open
Got a .45 on him
And he pushin' 'bout a 102
Always smokin' somethin'
He ain't worried 'bout nothin'
'Cause he ain't got nothing to lose

[Verse 1: Jessie Murph]
I got a thing for the hard liquor on ice
Short days and long nights
Marlboros out the window
Middle finger to the sky
Say you wanna get dangerous
Now you're speakin' my language
I forgot what your name is
So, I'ma call you mine (Mine)
I'ma call you mine (Mine)

[Chorus: Jessie Murph]
Got me wide, wide open
Got a .45 on him
And he pushin' 'bout a 102
Always smokin' somethin'
He ain't worried 'bout nothin'
'Cause he ain't got nothing to lose

[Post-Chorus: Jessie Murph]
I got a thing for the wild ones (Wild, wild, wild)
I got a thing for the wild ones, it's like he knew
I got a thing for the wild ones (Wild, wild, wild)
I got a thing for the wild ones, they like me too

[Verse 2: Jelly Roll]
(Yeah) I'm attracted to things that are really crazy
Asking me how I've been feelin' lately
Coming for mine, then it's do or die
I won't let it slide, no stealin' bases
No back-and-forth bargainin' (Now)
No bitchin' and arguin'
A whole lotta problems, livin' in Gotham
And Bunnie's my Harley Quinn (My Harley Quinn)
Was raised in the darkness, forgive me, I'm guarded (Guarded)
I have no shame, I'm in love with the heartless
The police will never take us alive
And cowgirls don't cry

[Chorus: Jessie Murph]
Got me wide, wide open
Got a .45 on him
And he pushin' 'bout a 102
Always smokin' somethin'
He ain't worried 'bout nothin'
'Cause he ain't got nothing to lose

[Post-Chorus: Jessie Murph & Jelly Roll, Jessie Murph]
I got a thing for the wild ones (Wild, wild, wild)
I got a thing for the wild ones, it's like he knew
I got a thing for the wild ones (Wild, wild, wild)
I got a thing for the wild ones, they like me too

[Outro: Jelly Roll & Jessie Murph]
Yeah (
Wild, wild, wild
)
A thing for the wild ones (
It's like he knew
)
I got a thing for the wild ones (
Wild, wild, wild
)
Got a thing for the wild ones (
They like me too, hm
)
