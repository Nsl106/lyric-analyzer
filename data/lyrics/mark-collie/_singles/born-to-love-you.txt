[Verse 1]
Some people go through life
Never knowing why they're here
They never find someone like you
The moment I touched your hand
And looked into your eyes
I knew what I was meant to do

[Chorus]
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
I was born to love you, 'til the day I die
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
I was born to love you, 'til the day I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I'm holding you
It feels just like a dream
And fear cuts through me like a knife
If I should wake up what would I do
If you weren't lying by my side

[Chorus]
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
I was born to love you, 'til the day I die
Girl I was born to love you, I was born to love you
I was born to love you, 'til the day I die

[Tag]
I was born to love you, I was born
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
'Til the day I die
