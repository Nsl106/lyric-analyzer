I'm tired of havin' all these troubles, think I've had enough
Excuse me for sayin', but baby I'm callin' your bluff

There's been too many times, too many reasons
Too much cryin' out loud
Too much bein' just another face in your crowd

Oh, and I've heard it before time and time again
You say it's the last time but it never ends
How much more can this poor heart take
You bend it until it breaks

There's been too many cards, too many letters
Strangers sending flowers
Too much worry, and stayin' up lately for hours

It's plain to see you don't care about me
You spread it all around
I'm tired of bein' the joke and the talk of the town

Oh, and I've heard it before time and time again
You say it's the last time but it never ends
How much more can this poor heart take
You bend it until it breaks

Oh, and I've heard it before time and time again
You say it's the last time but it never ends
How much more can this poor heart take
You bend it until it breaks
