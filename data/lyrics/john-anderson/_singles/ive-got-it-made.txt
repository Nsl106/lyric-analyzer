A high dollar woman in a low cut dress
God never wanted me to have a woman like that I guess
A forty room mansion sitting high on a hill
I ain't ever lived in a place like that and I never will

But I've got the mornin' sun, I've got the evenin' breeze
I got the woman that I love lyin' close to me
I've got a few good friends and all my bills are paid
I got the moon and stars above and I've got it made

I don't need a gold mine or a long limousine
I'm not the kind of man to surrender my soul to material things
Just give me a cane pole and a shady spot to sit
To me that's about as close to heaven as a man can get

But I've got the mornin' sun, I've got the evenin' breeze
I got the woman that I love lyin' close to me
I've got a few good friends and all my bills are paid
I got the moon and stars above and I've got it made

I've got a few good friends and all my bills are paid
I got the moon and stars above and I've got it made
I got the moon and stars above and I've got it made
