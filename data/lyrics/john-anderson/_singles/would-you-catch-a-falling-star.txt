[Verse 1]
You know the crowd was very small
For a country music show
But he faked a curtain call
Just like it was years ago
And then a lady grabbed his arm
As he staggered down the aisle
And with all his country charm
He addressed her with a smile

[Chorus]
Would you catch a fallen star
Before he crashes to the ground
Don't you know how people are
Nobody loves you when you're down
Pick me up and take him home
And I'll bring his old guitar
Sing a golden oldie song
If you'll catch a fallen star

[Verse 2]
He had a silver plated bus
And a million country fans
Now there's just a few of us
And he drives a little van
And they were beatin' down his door
The lovely women left and right
And now he's on the hardwood floor
A wonderin' where he'll spend the night

[Chorus]
Would you catch a fallen star
Before he crashes to the ground
Don't you know how people are
Nobody loves you when you're down
Pick him up and take him home
And he'll bring his old guitar
Sing a golden oldie song
If you'll catch a fallen star

[Coda]
Sing a golden country song
If you'll catch a fallen star
