There's a million oil rigs pumping
That black gold all over the world
Sheiks and cowboy billionaires
In limousines loaded with sparkling girls
But money can't buy happiness
Just listen to the stories they tell
All you need to really suceed in life
Is one good well

It takes one good well
Deep and ever-flowing
One good well
To draw from night and day
Pure and fine, it's yours and mine
And it's, always enough
We've got one good well
Overflowing with everlasting love

--- Instrumental ---

Don't it seem kinda funny
How people with a lot of money
Only hunger for more
You think they'd learn
That money can burn
It's love that keeps
The wolf from the door
Precious love lies deep inside
Hearts you can't buy and sell
When the money's low
Still we know we got
One good well

It takes one good well
Deep and ever-flowing
One good well
To draw from night and day
Pure and fine, it's yours and mine
And it's, always enough
We've got one good well
Overflowing with everlasting love

We've got one good well
Overflowing with everlasting love...
