Adam and Eve on a Saturday night
That's when the trouble started
She said Adam let's go for a bite
She led him through the garden

And ever since then we tried to make sense
Of this mystery emotion
But we might as well try to count the stars in the sky
Or those raindrops in the ocean

Chorus:
Well, you know it's true love
Deeper than deep
Hotter than a fire
Well, it's hard to find and it's harder to keep
It's the thing we most desire

I was alone for so many nights
I really started to wonder
If I had run outa chances to find
A spell I could fall under
Then you walked in like in a Elvis film
You were singing Love Me Tender
I was a hypnotized by your blue eyes
And the next thing I remember

Chorus:
Well you know it's true love
Deeper than deep
Hotter than a fire
Well, it's hard to find and it's harder to keep
It's the thing we most desire

And there is true love in a winkin' eye
And the sweet perfume that lingers
And it's a I love you on a new tattoo
And that diamond on her finger

Chorus:
Well, you know it's true love
Deeper than deep
Hotter than a fire
Well, it's hard to find and it's harder to keep
It's the thing we most desire

It's the true love we most desire...
