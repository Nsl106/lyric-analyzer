[Verse 1]
I left Oklahoma, drivin' in a Pontiac
Just about to lose my mind
I was goin' to Arizona, maybe on to California
Where the people all live so fine

[Verse 2]
My baby said, I's crazy, my mama called me lazy
I was gonna show 'em all this time
'Cause you know I ain't no fool and I don't need no more schoolin'
I was born to just walk the line

[Chorus]
Livin' on Tulsa time, livin' on Tulsa time
Well, you'll know I been through it
When I set my watch back to it
Livin' on Tulsa Time

[Verse 3]
Well, there I was in Hollywood, wishin' I was doin' good
Talkin' on the telephone line
But they don't need me in the movies and nobody sings my songs
Guess, I'm just a wastin' time

[Verse 4]
Well, then I got to thinkin', man I'm really sinkin'
An' I really had a flash this time
I had no business leavin' an' nobody would be grievin'
If I went on back to Tulsa time

[Chorus]
Livin' on Tulsa time, livin' on Tulsa time
Gonna set my watch back to it
'Cause you know I been through it
Livin' on Tulsa time

[Chorus]
Livin' on Tulsa time, livin' on Tulsa time
Gonna set my watch back to it
'Cause you know I been through it
Livin' on Tulsa time
