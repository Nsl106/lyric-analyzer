[Verse 1]
Likely as not, there's been better weather
I feel real sure, there's been better times
Right here tonight with you all around me
I'm so glad right now is mine

[Chorus]
Honey, tonight, make it all right
Turn on your smile for me for a while
Take me away from where I have been
I know you love me, but love me over again

[Verse 2]
You have the way to fill my emotions
Till there's not a word left in my mind
Times get so hard, so confusing
You make now a so much better time

[Chorus]
So, honey, tonight, make it all right
Turn on your smile for me for a while
Take me away from where I have been
I know you love me, but love me over again

[Chorus]
So, honey, tonight, make it all right
Turn on your smile for me for a while
Take me away from where I have been
I know you love me, but love me over again
