Oh, its late I know I should be leaving
We've both got someone waiting, we'll have to go
And it's so strange to think that I've just met you
I almost wish I had met you long ago

And in your eyes I see a certain look
And that same look must be in mine
And who knows just what we might have been
Another place another time

I'll admit in time that I'll forget you
'Cause the truth is I still love her after all
But even though we knew it couldn't happen
For a moment we felt something, Oh, so strong

And in your eyes I see a certain look
And that same look must be in mine
And who knows just what we might have been
Another place another time

And who knows just what we might have been
Another place another time...
