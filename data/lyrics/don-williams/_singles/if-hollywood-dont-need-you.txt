Well you know I'm not much good at writin' letters
So I gave up and decided that I'd call
Naw' there's really not much new to tell ya
Things back here they never change at all
It snowed today, it's cold here for November
But I hear the weather's warm out there

Oh, and if you see Burt Reynolds
Would you shake his hand for me
And tell ol' Burt , I've seen all his movies
Well, I hope you make the big time
I hope your dreams come true
But if Hollywood don't need you
Honey I still do

Last night I drove the truck to Amarillo
Some friends and I we had a laugh or two
But lately we don't cut up like we used to
'Cause all that I can think about is you
Well, I know this is what you've always wanted
But I know now that all I want is you

So if you see Burt Reynolds
Would you shake his hand for me
And tell ol' Burt , I've seen all his movies
Well, I hope you make the big time
I hope your dreams come true
But if Hollywood don't need you
Honey I still do
If Hollywood don't need you
Honey, I still do
