Sometimes you feel lost and far from home
Then with just one kiss you're a king on a throne
It can make you soar like an eagle
Or it can make you feel as meek as a dove
Whoa, that's the thing about love

You hope and pray the right one comes along
Some fools don't know what they've got till its gone
The very one you think will never hurt ya
Always seems to be, the one that does
Whoa, that's the thing about love

You can't have it
Until you give it
You can never give it enough
Whoa, that's the thing about love

Naw, you can't have it
Until you give it
You can never give it enough

Well, next time you come in a natural flow
Deep in the feelin's with your heart all aglow
Don't stop to try to understand it
Just thank your lucky stars, shinin' above, and say
Whoa, that's the thing about love

Whoa, that's the thing about love...
