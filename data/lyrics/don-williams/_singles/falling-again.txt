I should take my time, I know
Take it easy
Take it slow
Every heartache needs to mend
Before you love again

So I hold on for awhile
And try to keep this old heart free
And then I look across a room
And someone smiles at me

Oh, and heaven help me
Here I go again
Before I've even had the time for this old heart to mend
Oh, I just get over one heartache
And then here I go like a fool
Falling again

People tell me take your time
Wait awhile and clear your mind
Give yourself some time to heal
If you fall
Be sure it's real

But it seems that every time
I'm almost on my feet
Someone makes me say hello
Someone on the street

Oh, and heaven help me
Here I go again
Before I've even had the time for this old heart to mend
Oh, I just get over one heartache
And then here I go like a fool
Falling again
