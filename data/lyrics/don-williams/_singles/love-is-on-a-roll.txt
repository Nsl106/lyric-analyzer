I can't work late
Although I need the money
Gotta get home to my lovin honey
She'll be there waitin', waitin' impatiently
Love is on a roll
Love is on a good roll

Usually I meet with the boys on Friday
Only this mornin' she said 'this is my day
The look she gave me sent a shiver down into my soul
Love is on a roll
Love is on a good roll

Our love is on a roll
Our love is on a good roll

I'm a songwriter a professional dreamer
Mostly a singer but sometimes a screamer
I should know if anybody knows at all
When love is on a roll
Love is on a good roll

So I gotta go, I gotta get home early
Be with my woman, soft an curvy
Makes me feel like a king
And not a regular Joe
Love is on a roll
Love is on a good roll
Love is on a roll
Love is on a good roll

Our love is on a roll
Our love is on a good roll
Our love is on a roll
Our love is on a good roll

Love is on a roll
Love is on a good roll

Love is on a roll
Love is on a good roll
