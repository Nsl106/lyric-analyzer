First I get cold then hot
Think I'm on fire
But I'm not
Oh, what a pain I've got
It must be love

There's nothin' I can do
All that I want is you
Look what I'm goin' through
It must be love

It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
Fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I've been dreamin' of
Oh, what a feelin'
It must be love

Somethin' is wrong, alright
I think of you all night
Can't sleep till mornin' light
It must be love

Seein' you in my dreams
Feelin' you close to me
Oh, what eles can it be?
It must be love

It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
Fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I've been dreamin' of
Oh, what a feelin'
It must be love

It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
Fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I've been dreamin' of
Oh, what a feelin'
It must be love

It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
Fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I've been dreamin' of
Oh, what a feelin'
It must be love...
