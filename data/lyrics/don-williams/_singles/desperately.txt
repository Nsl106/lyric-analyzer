My heart is out of control
This ol' love struck so
Just lives for the moment you're around
When I hold on to you
It is all I can do
Just to keep my feet on the ground

Desperately
Loving you desperately
When you are not here with me
I get a little bit crazy

Constantly
Think about you constantly
Look at what you done to me
I'm just like a little baby
Oh, I love you desperately

--- Instrumental ---

Will I laugh?
Will I cry?
Will I live?
Will I die?
It all depends upon you

And it is dangerous
I know
To be lost in you so
But I'm that
There's nothing I can do

Desperately
Loving you desperately
When you are not here with me
I get a little bit crazy

Constantly
Think about you constantly
Look at what you done to me
I'm just like a little baby
Oh, I love you desperately

Desperately
Loving you desperately
When you are not here with me
I get a little bit crazy

Constantly
Think about you constantly
Look at what you done to me
I'm just like a little baby
Oh, I love you desperately
