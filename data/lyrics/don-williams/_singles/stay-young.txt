Oh, don't ya lose that light in your eyes
You're never too old to love, never too late to try
When somebody needs you
Give 'em all you can give
Oh, when you're livin' to love and a lovin' to live

Chorus:
Stay young keep your wheels in motion
You've got everything that you need
Stay young with your rock n' rollin'
All the best things in life are free

--- Instrumental ---

Oh, don't ya feel like playin' the fool
Just step outa line and break all the rules
Well, don't you let them tell you, Its not for you
Don't go growin' old, before you're due

Chorus:
Stay young keep your wheels in motion
You've got everything that you need
Stay young with your rock n' rollin'
All the best things in life are free

--- Instrumental ---

Chorus:
Stay young keep your wheels in motion
You've got everything that you need
Stay young with your rock n' rollin'
All the best things in life are free...
