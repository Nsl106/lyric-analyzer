[Verse 1]
Oh, all I needed was one look
One magic moment, was all it took
From that moment, I loved you so
Now that I found you I'm never gonna let you go

[Chorus]
So, c'mon say it, say it again
It sounds so good, just say it one more time, and then
Oh, if you mean it, say it again
The hard part's over, and the lovin' part begins

[Instrumental Solo]
Hmm-mmm, hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm-mmm, hmm-hmm-hmm

[Verse 2]
Oh, hold me closer, make me warm
I feel wanted, here in your arms
I've been lonely for too long
I've waited a lifetime for you to come along

[Chorus]
So, c'mon say it, say it again
It sounds so good, just say it one more time, and then
Oh, if you mean it, say it again
The hard part's over, and the lovin' part begins

[Chorus]
C'mon say it, say it again
It sounds so good, say it one more time, and then
Oh, if you mean it, say it again
The hard part's over, and the lovin' part begins

[Instrumental Outro]
