Well, I love to wander
On a sandy shore
And I love to wander
Down the streets of towns
I've never been before
Take me somewhere out of reach
Lie in unfamiliar sheets
And hear the ocean roar
Ask for more I could not do
Just as long as you're there too

Just as long as I have you
I'll go anywhere
Just as long as you're there too
I don't really care
I'll go anywhere you are
'Cause with you is where I belong

--- Instrumental ---

I've just got to have you
To make my life complete
I've just got to have you
There to be a part of everything I see
In the windows I walk past
In the mirror in the morning
In my photographs
In the candlelite cafes
Let me always see your face

Oh, it really doesn't matter
Just where the road leads
To the top of a mountain
Or down to the sea

Just as long as I have you
I'll go anywhere
Just as long as you're there too
I don't really care
I'll go anywhere you are
'Cause with you is where I belong

Just as long as I have you
Just as long as I have you...
