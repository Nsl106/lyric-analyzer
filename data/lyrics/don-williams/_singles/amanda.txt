[Verse 1]
I've held it all inward, Lord knows I've tried
It's an awful awakenin' in a country boy's life
To look in the mirror in total surprise
At the hair on your shoulders and the age in your eyes

[Chorus]
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should've made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should've made you a gentleman's wife

[Verse 2]
Well, a measure of people don't understand
The pleasures of life in a hillbilly band
I got my first guitar when I was fourteen
Now I'm crowding thirty and still wearing jeans

[Chorus]
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should've made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should've made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should've made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should've made you a gentleman's wife
