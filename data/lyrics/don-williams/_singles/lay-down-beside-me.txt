[Verse 1]
I've spent my life looking for you
Finding my way wasn't easy to do
But I knew there was you all the while
And it's been worth every mile

[Chorus]
So lay down beside me
Love me and hide me
Kiss all the hurtin' of this world away
Hold me so close that I feel your heartbeat
And don't ever wander away

[Verse 2]
Mornings and evenings all were the same
And there was no music till I heard your name
But I knew when I saw you smile
Now I can rest for awhile

[Chorus]
So lay down beside me
Love me and hide me
Kiss all the hurtin' of this world away
Hold me so close that I feel your heartbeat
And don't ever wander away
