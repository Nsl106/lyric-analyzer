[Verse 1]
I don't know who broke up with who
But she's in here chasin' tequila with High Noon
Don't know how long she's been movin' on
Maybe five weeks or five minutes, but it can't be too long
And we did that "What's your name?" thing
"Where you from and what's your favorite drink?"
She said, "Shut up, come and dance with me"
And now she's singin'

[Chorus]
"Girls just wanna have fun" at the top of her lungs
Don't even know she's 'bout to wreck someone
And, boy's, I'm in trouble now, ain't even tryna get out
So, come on, baby, take me down, down, down, yeah
Don't know what happened tonight, don't know what happened last week
Don't know what happеned to her, but she's 'bout to happеn to me
(Happen to me)
She 'bout to happen to me

[Verse 2]
She'll probably be the one that got away
But right now, I'm takin' every second I can take
So we keep talkin', and we keep drinkin'
Oh, and I keep on fallin'
And she keeps on singin'

[Chorus]
"Girls just wanna have fun" at the top of her lungs
Don't even know she's 'bout to wreck someone
And, boy's, I'm in trouble now, ain't even tryna get out
So, come on, baby, take me down, down, down, yeah
Don't know what happened tonight, don't know what happened last week
Don't know what happened to her, but she's 'bout to happen to me

[Bridge]
Oh, we keep on talkin', and we keep on drinkin'
And I keep on fallin', she keeps on singin'
Girls, mmm, girls, mmm-mmm
Oh

[Chorus]
"Girls just wanna have fun" at the top of her lungs
Don't even know she's 'bout to wreck someone (Wreck someone)
And, boy's, I'm in trouble now, ain't even tryna get out
So, come on, baby, take me down, down, down, yeah
Don't know what happened tonight, don't know what happened last week
Don't know what happened to her, but she's 'bout to happen to me
(She 'bout to happen, mmm, she 'bout to happen)
(Yeah, she 'bout to, she 'bout to, she 'bout to)
