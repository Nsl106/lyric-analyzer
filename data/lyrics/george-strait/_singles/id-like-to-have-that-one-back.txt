[Verse 1]
I heard somebody speak her name
They said she still was looking fine
And I could feel that same old flame
I once felt when she was mine

Always thought that I was missing something
But I found out much too late
There'll never be another who'll love me that way

[Chorus]
I'd like to have that one back
I've never known someone so true
And a love that pure and sweet is one a man should never lose

And if my lips had said I'm sorry
She might have stopped right in her tracks
But now I find my poor heart saying I'd like to have that one back

[Verse 2]
I can almost see her standing there
Tears rolling down her face
As she packed away her memories
In that old worn out suitcase

If I'd only known then what I know now
I'd never open that door
They just don't make hearts like hers anymore

[Chorus]
I'd like to have that one back
I've never known someone so true
And a love that pure and sweet is one a man should never lose

And if my lips had said I'm sorry
She might have stopped right in her tracks
I wouldn't hear my poor heart saying I'd like to have that one back

[Outro]
I wouldn't hear my poor heart saying
I'd like to have that one back
