[Verse 1]
Nickels and dimes, memories and wine
She's on his mind once again
The same old stool, the same old fool
Played by the rules but didn't win

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's an old love in his heart that he can't lose
He tried forgetting, but he knows that it's no use

[Chorus]
He's got a fool hearted memory
It won't let him see that she walked out the door
He's got a fool hearted memory
And he sits patiently here every night so it can fool him more

[Verse 2]
She was his girl, his only world
That string of pearls that slipped away
A thousand dimes a thousand times
He doesn't mind what they say

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He fills the jukebox, then plays the same old song
He fills his glass and then he turns her memory on

[Chorus]
But it's a fool hearted memory
It won't let him see that she walked out the door
He's got a fool hearted memory
And he sits patiently here every night so it can fool him more

[Chorus]
He's got a fool hearted memory
It won't let him see that she walked out the door
He's got a fool hearted memory
And he sits patiently here every night so it can fool him more
