[Verse 1]
I'm not yours an' baby you're not mine
We've got somethin' and it sure is fine
Let's take our love
One night at a time

[Verse 2]
There's one thing that we both agree
I like you and baby you like me
Let's take our love
One night at a time

[Chorus]
All night, love all night
Practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right
One night at a time

[Chorus]
All night, love all night
Practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right
One night at a time

[Bridge]
Oh, I think about you all day long
It feels so good it can't be wrong
I've got my fingers crossed
That this goes on and on

[Verse 3]
Tomorrow, well, that's another day
Come on baby now, what do you say
Let's take our love
One night at a time

[Chorus]
All night, love all night
Practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right
One night at a time

[Bridge]
Oh, I think about you all day long
It feels so good it can't be wrong
I've got my fingers crossed
That this goes on and on

[Chorus]
All night, love all night
Practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right
One night at a time

[Chorus]
All night, love all night
Practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right
One night at a time

[Chorus]
All night, love all night
Practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right
One night at a time

[Outro]
All night, love all night
