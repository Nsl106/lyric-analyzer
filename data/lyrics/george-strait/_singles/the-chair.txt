[Verse 1]
Well, excuse me
But I think you've got my chair
No, that one is not taken
I don't mind if you sit here, I'll be glad to share
Yeah, it's usually packed here on Friday nights
Oh, if you don't mind, could I talk you out of a light?

[Verse 2]
Well, thank you, could I drink you a buy?
Oh, listen to me, what I mean is can I buy you a drink?
Anything you please
Oh, you're welcome, well, I don't think I caught your name
Are you waiting for someone to meet you here?
Well, that makes two of us, glad you came

[Chorus]
No, I don't know the name of the band, but they're good
Aren't they, would you like to dance?
Yeah, I like this song too, it reminds me of you and me
Baby, do you think there is a chance
That later on I could drive you home?
No, I do not mind at all
Oh, I like you too, and to tell you the truth
That wasn't my chair after all
[Outro]
Oh, I like you too, and to tell you the truth
That wasn't my chair after all
