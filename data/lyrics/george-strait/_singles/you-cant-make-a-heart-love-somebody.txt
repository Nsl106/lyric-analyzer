[Verse 1]
At a table for two with candle light and wine
That diamond burning holes in his pockets
Thinking now's the perfect time
When he popped the question
He could see the teardrops fill her eyes
She said, "I knew this was coming
And I'm sorry, but I hope you realize"

[Chorus]
You can't make a heart love somebody
You can tell it what to do, but it won't listen at all
You can't make a heart love somebody
You can lead a heart to love, but you can't make it fall

[Verse 2]
Then she reached for his hand
And said, "I want you to know
I've done everything that I know of
To make the feeling grow
I've begged and I've pleaded with my heart
But there's no getting through
My heart's the only part of me
That's not in love with you"

[Chorus]
You can't make a heart love somebody
You can tell it what to do, but it won't listen at all
You can't make a heart love somebody
You can lead a heart to love, but you can't make it fall

[Outro]
You can lead a heart to love, but you can't make it fall
