[Verse 1]
Love is so beautiful
When everything is fine
But when it is like hers and mine
It lives and dies at least ten thousand times

[Chorus]
Tell me something bad about Tulsa
How those old oil wells smell in the wind
Tell me something bad about Tulsa
So I won't have to go back believing I belong there again

[Verse 2]
Eyes as blue as Tulsa skies I kept getting lost in when I met her
Hair like Oklahoma sand I could run my hands through forever
But all good things must end, all rivers have to bend
I keep running out, but she keeps pulling me back in

[Chorus]
Tell me something bad about Tulsa
How those old oil wells smell in the wind
Tell me something bad about Tulsa
So I won't have to go back believing I belong there again

[Outro]
Tell me something bad about Tulsa
So I won't have to go back believing I belong there again
