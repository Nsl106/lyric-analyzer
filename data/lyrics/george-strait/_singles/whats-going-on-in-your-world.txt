[Verse 1]
What's going on in your world?
I hope that you're doing fine
I just called to say there's not a day
That you don't cross my mind
I just wanted to see if you feel like me
Sorry that we said goodbye
So what's going on in your world?
It sure is lonesome in mine

[Chorus]
Just tell me that you're happy
And I'll hang up the phone
Just tell me you don't need me anymore
And I'll leave you alone
I just wondered if you had somebody new
After all of this time
So what's going on in your world?
It sure is lonesome in mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Just tell me that you're happy
And I'll hang up the phone
Just tell me you don't need me anymore
And I'll leave you alone
I just wondered if you had somebody new
After all of this time
So what's going on in your world?
It sure is lonesome in mine

[Outro]
What's going on in your world?
It sure is lonesome in mine
