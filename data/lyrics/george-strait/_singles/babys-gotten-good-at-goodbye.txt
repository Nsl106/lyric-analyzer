[Verse 1]
What a rotten day this turned out to be
I still can't believe she'd leave so easily
She just got all her things, threw them into a pile
Then she loaded her car and said after a while
She'd done this before, but this time she didn't cry

[Chorus]
That's why I'm sitting on the front steps
Staring down the road
Wondering if she'll come back
This time I don't know
After she packed, when she looked back
There were no tears in her eyes
And that's got me worried thinking maybe my baby's
Gotten good at goodbye

[Verse 2]
All the times before she'd break down and cry
She'd make her threats, but her heart wasn't set on goodbye
She just wanted me to hear what she had to say
Now I'm lost for words since she went away
She may not return, for this time she didn't cry

[Chorus]
That's why I'm sitting on the front steps
Staring down the road
Wondering if she'll come back
This time I don't know
After she packed, when she looked back
There were no tears in her eyes
And that's got me worried thinking maybe my baby's
Gotten good at goodbye

[Chorus]
That's why I'm sitting on the front steps
Staring down the road
Wondering if she'll come back
This time I don't know
After she packed, when she looked back
There were no tears in her eyes
And that's got me worried thinking maybe my baby's
Gotten good at goodbye
