[Verse 1]
You're like the warm sunshine
I think of you all the time
I've fallen for you and that's a fact
What do you say to that?

[Verse 2]
You're always in my dreams
I think you know what they mean
My heart knows this is real at last
What do you say to that?

[Chorus]
Life could never be the same without you
Love was never really love without you
Here beside you is really where it's at
What do you say to that?

[Verse 3]
I promise I'll never leave
I'll always want you with me
Loving you won't ever be old hat
What do you say to that?

[Chorus]
Life could never be the same without you
Love was never really love without you
Here beside you is really where it's at
What do you say to that?

[Outro]
You're like the warm sunshine
I think of you all the time
I've fallen for you and that's a fact
What do you say to that?
My heart knows this is real at last
What do you say to that?
