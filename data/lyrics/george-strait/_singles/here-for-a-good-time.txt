[Verse 1]
I'm not gonna lay around and whine and moan
'Cause somebody done done me wrong
Don't think for a minute that I'm gonna sit around
And sing some old sad song

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I believe it's half full, not a half empty glass
Every day I wake up knowing it could be my last

[Chorus]
I ain't here for a long time, I'm here for a good time
So bring on the sunshine, to hell with the red wine
Pour me some moonshine
When I'm gone, put it in stone, "He left nothing behind"
I ain't here for a long time, I'm here for a good time

[Verse 2]
Folks are always dreaming 'bout what they'd like to do
But I like to do just what I like
I'll take the chance, dance the dance
It might be wrong but then again it might be right

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's no way of knowing what tomorrow brings
Life's too short to waste it, I say bring on anything

[Chorus]
I ain't here for a long time, I'm here for a good time
So bring on the sunshine, to hell with the red wine
Pour me some moonshine
When I'm gone, put it in stone, "He left nothing behind"
I ain't here for a long time, I'm here for a good time
I ain't here for a long time, I'm here for a good time
