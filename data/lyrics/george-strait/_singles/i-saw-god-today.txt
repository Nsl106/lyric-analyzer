[Verse 1]
Just walked down the street to the coffee shop
Had to take a break
I've been by her side for eighteen hours straight
Saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk
Pushing up through the concrete
Like it was planted right there for me to see

[Pre-Chorus]
The flashing lights
The honking horns
All seem to fade away
But in the shadow of the hospital
At 5:08
I saw God today

[Chorus]
I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's here
But I don't look
Near as often as I should
Yeah, I know I should
His fingerprints are everywhere
I just slow down to stop and stare
Open my eyes and man I swear
I saw God today

[Verse 2]
Saw a couple walking by
They were holding hands
And she had that glow
Yeah, I couldn't help
But notice she was starting to show
Stood there for a minute
Taking in the sky
Lost in that sunset
A splash of amber melted into shades of red

[Chorus]
I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's here
But I don't look
Near as often as I should
Yeah, I know I should
His fingerprints are everywhere
I just slow down to stop and stare
Open my eyes and man I swear
I saw God today

[Verse 3]
Got my face pressed up against the nursery glass
She's sleeping like a rock
My name on her wrist
Wearing tiny pink socks
She's got my nose
She's got her Mama's eyes
My brand new baby girl
She's a miracle
I saw God today
