[Verse 1]
She sparkles, she dazzles, she lights up the room
We walk together to a table for two
Every man stares but her eyes are only for me
We take to the dance floor, she squeezes my hand
I can't believe just how lucky I am

[Chorus]
Meanwhile, back in the back of my memory
You're still dancing with me
And I'm holding you once again
Meanwhile

[Verse 2]
We move to the end of a beautiful night
Tender the kisses, soft candlelight
She draws the curtains and slowly we climb up the stairs
And reach for each other, the passion begins
We fall together as lovers and then

[Chorus]
Meanwhile, back in the back of my memory
You're still lying with me
And I'm holding you once again

[Bridge]
I try and I try, Lord knows I do
But each time my heart beats back to you

[Chorus]
Meanwhile, I'll go on living my life now
I'll find a way somehow
Oh but meanwhile, back in the back of my memory
You'll always be with me but I'll never hold you again
Meanwhile
