[Verse 1]
I thought you and me were something special
Thought you thought that way too
Now I know that this old boy just ain't the
Best you think you'll ever do

[Chorus]
It ain't cool to be crazy about you
It ain't suave or debonair
To let you know I care, like I do
It ain't smart to be so reckless with my heart
I should have known right from the start
I'd end up like a fool; believe me, it ain't cool

[Verse 2]
All of my friends, they tried to tell me
What and what not to do
It took a while for them to sell me
But finally they got through

[Chorus]
It ain't cool to be crazy about you
It ain't suave or debonair
To let you know I care, like I do
It ain't smart to be so reckless with my heart
I should have known right from the start
I'd end up like a fool; believe me, it ain't cool
