[Verse 1]
I got sent home from school one day with a shiner on my eye
Fighting was against the rules and it didn't matter why
When dad got home I told that story just like I'd rehearsed
Then stood there on those trembling knees and waited for the worst

[Chorus]
And he said, "Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us"
He said, "Daddies don't just love their children every now and then
It's a love without end, amen"
It's a love without end, amen

[Verse 2]
When I became a father in the spring of '81
There was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my father's son
And when I thought my patience had been tested to the end
I took my daddy's secret and I passed it on to him

[Chorus]
I said, "Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us"
I said, "Daddies don't just love their children every now and then
It's a love without end, amen"
It's a love without end, amen

[Verse 3]
Last night I dreamed I died and stood outside those pearly gates
When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake
If they know half the things I've done, they'll never let me in
And then somewhere from the other side, I heard these words again

[Chorus]
And they said, "Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us"
"You see, daddies don't just love their children every now and then
It's a love without end, amen"
It's a love without end, amen
