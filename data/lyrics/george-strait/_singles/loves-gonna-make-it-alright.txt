[Verse 1]
Girl, you've had one of those days
Seems like they've been going around
You're a long way from being where you wanna be
When the world isn't going your way
Whatever bad luck is getting you down
Honey, I'll be right here for you
With open arms, you can run to me

[Chorus]
Baby, love's gonna make it
Love's gonna make it alright
Baby, love's gonna make it
Love's gonna make it alright
Tonight, tonight, tonight

[Verse 2]
We can go out and paint the town
We can dance your cares away
We can watch 'em all fall out on the floor
And if you want to we can close 'em down
And we can leave whenever you say
I'll chase you down the hallway
Watch the sun come up behind our bedroom door

[Chorus]
Baby, love's gonna make it
Love's gonna make it alright
Baby, love's gonna make it
Love's gonna make it alright
Tonight, tonight, tonight

[Bridge]
That's the good thing, girl, about me and you
There ain't nothing that loving can't get us through

[Chorus]
Baby, love's gonna make it
Love's gonna make it alright
Baby, love's gonna make it
Love's gonna make it alright
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
