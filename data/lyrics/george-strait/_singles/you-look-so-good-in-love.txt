[Verse 1]
Oh, how you sparkle and oh, how you shine
That flush on your cheeks is more than the wine
And he must do something that I didn't do
Whatever he's doing, it looks good on you

[Chorus]
You look so good in love
You want him, that's easy to see
You look so good in love
And I wish you still wanted me

[Verse 2]
He must have stolen some stars from the sky
And gave them to you to wear in your eyes
I had my chances, but I set you free
And now I wonder why I couldn't see

[Chorus]
You look so good in love
You want him, that's easy to see
You look so good in love
And I wish you still wanted me

[Bridge]
Darling, I've wasted a lot of years not seeing the real you
But tonight your beauty is shining through
And I never took the time to let you know
So before he takes you away, please let me say

[Chorus]
You look so good in love
You want him, that's easy to see
You look so good in love
And I wish you still wanted me

[Outro]
You look so good in love
