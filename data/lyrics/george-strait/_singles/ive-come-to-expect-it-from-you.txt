[Verse 1]
So upset, nervous wreck
Can't believe you said goodbye
Sit and smoke, cry and joke
About these tears in my eyes

[Chorus 1]
How could you do what you've gone and done to me?
I wouldn't treat a dog the way you treated me
But that's what I get
I've come to expect it from you

[Verse 2]
A million times, a million lines
And I bought them, every one
You don't care, you rip and tear
Every dream I've counted on

[Chorus 2]
I guess that I should thank my unlucky stars
That I'm alive and you're the way you are
But that's what I get
I've come to expect it from you

[Chorus 1]
How could you do what you've gone and done to me?
I wouldn't treat a dog the way you treated me
But that's what I get
I've come to expect it from you

[Verse 3]
I could raise hell, but what the hell?
It wouldn't do a bit of good
Pack and leave, my heart agrees
It seems to think that I should

[Chorus 3]
There won't be no more next time doing me wrong
You'll come back this time to find out that I'm gone
But that's what you get
You should expect that from me

[Outro]
That's what I get
I've come to expect it from you
