[Verse 1]
He looks up from second base
And dad's up in the stands
He saw the hit, the run, the slide
There ain't no bigger fan
In the parking lot after the game
He said, "Dad, I thought you had a plane to catch?"
He smiled and said, "Yeah, son, I did"

[Chorus]
But life's not the breath you take, the breathing in and out
That gets you through the day ain't what it's all about
You just might miss the point trying to win the race
Life's not the breaths you take, but the moments that take your breath away

[Verse 2]
Fast forward fifteen years
And a thousand miles away
Boy's built a life, he's got a wife
And a baby due today
He hears a voice saying, "I made it, son"
Says, "I told you, dad, you didn't have to come"
He smiles and says, "Yeah, I know you did"

[Chorus]
But life's not the breath you take, the breathing in and out
That gets you through the day ain't what it's all about
You just might miss the point trying to win the race
Life's not the breaths you take, but the moments that take your breath away

[Bridge]
Just like it took my breath when she was born
Just like it took my breath away when dad took his last that morn

[Verse 3]
Life's not the breaths you take, the breathing in and out
That gets you through the day, ain't what it's all about
You just might miss the point if you don't slow down the pace
Life's not the breaths you take, but the moments that take your breath away

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
