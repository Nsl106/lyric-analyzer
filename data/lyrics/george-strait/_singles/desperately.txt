[Verse 1]
Every night it's the same, I hear you calling my name
You're lying next to me
I give into your charms, you disappear in my arms
I realize it's just a dream

[Chorus]
But desperately, I long to feel your touch
But you left me all alone in love

[Verse 2]
Now I shake the sleep from my head and try to crawl out of bed
Today is just another day
I make the coffee for one, I turn the radio on
Pretend that everything's okay

[Chorus]
But desperately, I long to feel your touch
But you left me all alone in love

[Verse 3]
And now I know there's no reason to smile
It's gonna take me a while
'Cause I still love you desperately

[Chorus]
Desperately, I long to feel your touch
But you left me all alone in love

[Verse 4]
And now I watch the sun going down, there ain't nobody around
I feel the night and the breeze
I keep on telling myself I don't need nobody else
And I can do as I please

[Chorus]
But desperately, I long to feel your touch
But you left me all alone in love
And now I desperately long to feel your touch
But you left me all alone in love

[Outro]
And now every night it's the same, I hear you calling my name
I still love you desperately
I still love you, I still want you
I still love you desperately
