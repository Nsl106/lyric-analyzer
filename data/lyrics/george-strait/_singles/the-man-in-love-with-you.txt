[Verse 1]
I'm not the hero who will always save the day
Don't always wear the white hat, don't always know the way
I may not even be the dream you wanted to come true
But I'll always be the man in love with you

[Verse 2]
I'm not the key that opens every door
I don't have the power to give you all you want and more
But when you're needing something special you can hold on to
I'll always be the man in love with you

[Verse 3]
I never could work miracles
There may be others who can do what I can't do
But no one else can be as good as me at loving you

[Verse 4]
So when the world won't turn the way you wish it would
And the dreams you have don't come alive as often as they should
Remember that there's someone there whose heart is always true
I'll always be the man in love with you

[Outro]
Remember that there's someone there whose heart is always true
Someone there to help you make it through
I'll always be the man in love with you
