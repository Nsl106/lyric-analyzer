[Verse 1]
Well I ain't seen her lately, and she never calls
She don't ask my friends about me, gives no clues at all
That a fire might still be burning yet
I'd say she's about as gone as a girl can get

[Verse 2]
She don't even show up in my dreams at night
But my stubborn old memory keeps holding on tight
Sure makes it hard to forget
She's about as gone as a girl can get

[Chorus]
She's out of here, she disappeared without a trace
More or less unimpressed by the tears on my face
Destination unknown, she just dropped out of sight
Last seen heading right on out of my life
Like a stranger I ain't never met
She's about as gone as a girl can get

[Chorus]
She's out of here, she disappeared without a trace
More or less unimpressed by the tears on my face
Destination unknown, she just dropped out of sight
Last seen heading right on out of my life
Like a stranger I ain't never met
She's about as gone as a girl can get

[Outro]
Like a stranger I ain't never met
She's about as gone as a girl can get
