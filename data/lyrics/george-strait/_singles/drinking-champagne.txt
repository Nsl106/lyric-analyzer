[Chorus]
I'm drinking champagne, feeling no pain 'til early morning
Dining and dancing with every pretty girl I can find
I'm having a fling with a pretty young thing 'til early morning
Knowing tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind

[Verse]
Guilty conscience, I guess
Though I must confess
I never loved you much when you were mine

[Chorus]
So I'll keep drinking champagne, feeling no pain 'til early morning
Dining and dancing with every pretty girl I can find
Having a fling with a pretty young thing 'til early morning
Knowing tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind

[Verse]
Guilty conscience, I guess
Though I must confess
I never loved you much when you were mine

[Chorus]
So I'll keep drinking champagne, feeling no pain 'til early morning
Dining and dancing with every pretty girl I can find
I'll keep having a fling with a pretty young thing 'til early morning
Knowing tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind
