[Chorus]
Adalida, pretty little Cajun queen
Sweet Dixie flower, the belle of the bayou
You're every young man's dream
Adalida, I'd walk through a hurricane
To stand beside you, sweet Adalida
I'd swim the Pontchartrain

[Verse 1]
Oh no, hear you coming down the road
With your cotton dress a-swishin', you're getting some attention
From all the boys in Thibodaux
Oh my, really filling up their eyes
Smilin' and a-winkin', I know what they're thinkin'
But I'm the only one who loves you so

[Chorus]
Adalida, pretty little Cajun queen
Sweet Dixie flower, the belle of the bayou
You're every young man's dream
Adalida, I'd walk through a hurricane
To stand beside you, sweet Adalida
I'd swim the Pontchartrain

[Verse 2]
Oh no, hottest little dish I know
I know you can tell it, you're making me so jealous
From my head down to my toes
Oh me, you could make a redneck green
The way that you're lookin', you got me cookin'
And I ain’t talking 'bout étouffée

[Chorus]
Adalida, pretty little Cajun queen
Sweet Dixie flower, the belle of the bayou
You're every young man's dream
Adalida, I'd walk through a hurricane
To stand beside you, sweet Adalida
I'd swim the Pontchartrain

[Outro]
To stand beside you, sweet Adalida
To stand beside you, sweet Adalida
Just to stand beside a my sweet Adalida
I'd swim the Pontchartrain
