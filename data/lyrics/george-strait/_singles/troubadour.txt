[Verse 1]
I still feel twenty-five most of the time
I still raise a little Cain with the boys
Honky Tonks and pretty women
But Lord I'm still right there with 'em
Singing above the crowd and the noise

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like Jesse James
Still trying to make a name
Knowing nothing's gonna change what I am
I was a young troubadour
When I rode in on a song
And I'll be an old troubadour when I'm gone

[Verse 2]
Well, the truth about a mirror
Is that a damned old mirror
Don't really tell the whole truth
It don't show what's deep inside
Or read between the lines
And it's really no reflection of my youth

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like Jesse James
Still trying to make a name
Knowing nothing's gonna change what I am
I was a young troubadour
When I rode in on a song
I'll be an old troubadour when I'm gone
I was a young troubadour
When I rode in on a song
And I'll be an old troubadour when I'm gone

[Outro]
I'll be an old troubadour when I'm gone
