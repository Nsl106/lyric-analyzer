[Verse 1]
We both said some things I know we never meant
And when I slammed the door tonight you wondered where I went
If I know you, you're probably wondering what to do
You're thinking that I'm gone for good, if I know you

[Chorus]
But if I know me, I'll turn this car around
I won't get halfway through town, and I'll be sorry
I'll stop and call, and you'll say you're sorry too
And I'll come running back to you, if I know me

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I lose my head, say things to break your heart
Forgetting if I lost your love, it would tear my world apart
If I know you, you didn't mean one single thing you said
Truth be known, you're dying, crying, lying there in bed

[Chorus]
But if I know me, I'll turn this car around
I won't get halfway through town, and I'll be sorry
I'll stop and call, and you'll say you're sorry too
And I'll come running back to you, if I know me

[Outro]
If I know me, and I know me
