[Verse  1-George Strait]
When did you stop loving me?
How long have I been a memory?
I've got to know for my own sanity
Tell me when did you stop loving me?

[Verse  2-George Strait]
Was it that night that you stayed out until dawn?
You know that night has haunted me for so long
Or was your love already cold?
Tell me please I got to know
Darling when did you stop loving me?

[Verse  3-George Strait]
There was a time when you worshipped where I stood
Heaven knows I'd bring it back if I could
Now I can tell when we make love
It ain't me you're thinking of
Tell me when did you stop loving me?
Darling, when did you stop loving me?
