[Verse 1]
I felt the rush of the Rio Grande
Into Yellowstone and I've seen first-hand
Niagara Falls and the lights of Vegas
I've criss-crossed down to Key Biscayne
And Chi-town via Bangor, Maine
Think I've seen it all, and all I can say is

[Chorus]
How 'bout them cowgirls?
Boys, ain't they something?
Sure are some proud girls
And you can't tell them nothing
And I tell you right now, girls
May just be seven wonders
Of this big, old round world
But how 'bout them cowgirls?

[Verse 2]
She's a-ridin' colts in Steamboat Springs
Baling hay outside Abilene
She's trying hard to fit in in some city
But her home is 'neath that big, blue sky
And the Northern Plains and those other wide
Open spaces, nowadays, there ain't as many

[Chorus]
How 'bout them cowgirls?
Boys, ain't they something?
Sure are some proud girls
And you can't tell them nothing
And I tell you right now, girls
May just be seven wonders
Of this big, old round world
But how 'bout them cowgirls?

[Bridge]
Boy, she don't need you and she don't need me
She can do just fine on her own two feet
But she wants a man who wants her to be herself
And she'll never change, don't know how to hide
Her stubborn will or her fighting side
But you treat her right and she'll love you like no one else

[Chorus]
Yeah, how 'bout them cowgirls?
Boys, ain't they something?
Sure are some proud girls
But you can't beat their loving
And I tell you right now, girls
May just be seven wonders
Of this big, old round world
But how 'bout them cowgirls?
How 'bout 'em, boys?
