[Chorus]
You've got to have an ace in the hole
A little secret that nobody knows
Life is a gamble, a game we all play
But you need to save something for a rainy day
You've got to learn to play your cards right
If you expect to win in life
Don't put it all on the line for just one roll
You've got to have an ace in the hole

[Verse 1]
If you're headed down a one way street
And you're not sure it's the way you want to go
In money or love, or all the above
Have a little more than what you show

[Verse 2]
When life deals out a surprise
Have a few surprises of your own
No matter what you do, no matter where you go
You've got to have an ace in the hole

[Chorus]
You've got to have an ace in the hole
A little secret that nobody knows
Life is a gamble, a game we all play
But you need to save something for a rainy day
You've got to learn to play your cards right
If you expect to win in life
Don't put it all on the line for just one roll
You've got to have an ace in the hole

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Don't put it all on the line for just one roll
You've got to have an ace in the hole
No matter what you do, no matter where you go
You've got to have an ace in the hole
