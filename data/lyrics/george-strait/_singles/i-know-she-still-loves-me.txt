[Verse 1]
There's just a hint of indifference
In her lack of conversation when we talk
And the subject matters change
There's no mention of our future now at all
She still kisses me each morning
But it seems more like a habit than before
I know she still loves me
But I don't think she likes me anymore

[Verse 2]
She used to laugh at all my jokes
But lately I can't seem to make her smile
And the last time we made love, it was good
But God, it's been a while
She's always there when I get home
But she's no longer waiting at the door
I know she still loves me
But I don't think she likes me anymore

[Bridge]
'Cause it's just a little colder every time I hold her
She's just going through the motions
From what's left of her devotion
And it scares me half to death
Wonderin' what tomorrow holds in store
I know she still loves me
But I don't think she likes me anymore

[Outro]
Right now I know she loves me
But I don't think she likes me anymore
