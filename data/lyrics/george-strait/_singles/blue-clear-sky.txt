[Verse 1]
You swear you've had enough
You're ready to give up
On that little lie they call love
Then out of the blue clear sky

[Verse 2]
Fallin' right into your hands
Like rain on the desert sand
It's the last thing you had planned
Then out of the blue clear sky

[Chorus]
Here she comes a walkin' talkin' true love
Sayin' I been lookin' for you love
Surprise your new love has arrived
Out of the blue clear sky

[Verse 3]
Ain't love a funny thing
One day you're givin' up the dream
And the next you're pickin' out a ring
Out of the blue clear sky

[Chorus 2]
Here she comes a walkin' talkin' true love
Sayin' I been lookin' for you love
Surprise your new love has arrived
Out of the blue clear sky
Here she comes a walkin' talkin' true love
Sayin' I been lookin' for you love
Surprise your new love has arrived
Out of the blue clear sky
Here she comes a walkin' talkin' true love
Sayin' I been lookin' for you love
Surprise your new love has arrived
Out of the blue clear sky
Out of the blue clear sky
