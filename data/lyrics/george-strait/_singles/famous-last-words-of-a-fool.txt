[Verse 1]
I told her I wouldn't miss her at all
As she walked to the door
I couldn't care less if she didn't care anymore
And with tears in my eyes
I lied
I was glad we were through
As she drove away crying
At the famous last words of a fool

[Chorus]
Famous last words of a fool
Famous last words of a fool
"You won't break my heart"
And "I don't love you"
Famous last words of a fool

[Verse 2]
The first night without her would be easy
I kept telling myself
All the while dying
At the thought of her lying somewhere else
And there'll be nothing to it
I'll easily find someone new
As my breaking heart echoed
The famous last words of a fool

[Chorus]

[Outro]
"You won't break my heart"
And "I don't love you."
Famous last words of a fool
