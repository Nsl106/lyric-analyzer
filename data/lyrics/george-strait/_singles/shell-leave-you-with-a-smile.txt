[Pre-Chorus]
At first she's going to come on strong
Like she'll love you all night long
Like it's going out of style
Then she'll leave you with a smile

[Verse 1]
You're gonna give her all your heart
Then she'll tear your world apart
You're gonna cry a little while
Still she'll leave you with a smile

[Chorus]
Well you can't help but wonder
Why you can't help but love her
But you can't help but love her
And all that hurting was more than worth it
It's written all over your face

[Verse 2]
One day you'll pass her on the street
With that guy you used to be
She'll say hello and walk on by
Then she'll leave you with a smile

[Chorus]
Well you can't help but wonder
Why you can't help but love her
But you can't help but love her
And all that hurting was more than worth it
It's written all over your face

[Pre-Chorus]
At first she's going to come on strong
Like she'll love you all night long
Like it's going out of style
Then she'll leave you with a smile

[Outro]
Ah, she's going to love you
She going to leave you with a smile
Ah, she's going to love you
She going to leave you with a smile
