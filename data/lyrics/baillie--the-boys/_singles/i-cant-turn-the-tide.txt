If my love is not enough to hold you down
Then what more can I give to you?
If I could, I'd reach into your heart somehow
And find a way to make you stay

But I can't turn the tide when it's goin' out on me
I can't keep you here if you wanna leave
A sailor's at the mercy of the sea
I can't turn the tide, when it's going out on me

In my heart I only want the best for you
And I hope you find what you're looking for
Life goes on, there's nothin' else that I can do
And if it's meant to be, you'll come back to me

But I can't turn the tide when it's goin' out on me
I can't keep you here if you wanna leave
A sailor's at the mercy of the sea
I can't turn the tide, when it's going out on me

Ooooh sail away, sail away

I can't turn the tide when it's goin' out on me
I can't keep you here if you wanna leave
I can't turn the tide when it's goin' out on me
I can't turn the tide
When it's goin' out on me

Oooh ooh ooh
