[Verse 1]
Back when I was young, couldn't wait to grow up
Get away and get out on my own
And looking back now, ain't it funny how
I've been trying to get back home, yeah?

[Verse 2]
When my low self esteem needs a man loving me
And I find me a perfect catch
Then I see my friends having wild weekends
And I don't wanna get quite so attached

[Pre-Chorus]
Just as soon as I get what I want, I get unsatisfied
Good is good but could be better

[Chorus]
I keep looking, I keep looking for
I keep looking for something more
I always wonder what's on the other side
Of the number two door
I keep looking, looking for something more

[Verse 3]
Well, the straight-haired girls, they all want curls
And the brunettes wanna be blonde
It's your typical thing, you got yin, you want yang
It just goes on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
They say, hey, it's only human to never be satisfied
Well I guess that I'm as human as the next one

[Chorus]
I keep looking, I keep looking for
I keep looking for something more
I always wonder what's on the other side
Of the number two door
I keep looking, looking for something more

[Pre-Chorus]
Just as soon as I get what I want, I get unsatisfied
Hey, good is good but could be better

[Chorus]
I keep looking, I keep looking for
I keep looking for something more
I always wonder what's on the other side
Of the number two door
I keep looking, looking for something more
