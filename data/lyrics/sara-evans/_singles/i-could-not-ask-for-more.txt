[Verse 1]
Lyin' here with you
Listening to the rain
Smilin' just to see
The smile upon your face

[Chorus]
These are the moments I thank God that I'm alive
These are the moments I'll remember all my life
I've found all I've waited for
And I could not ask for more

[Verse 2]
Lookin' in your eyes
Seein' all I need
Everything you are
Is everything in me

[Chorus]
These are the moments I know Heaven must exist
These are the moments I know all I need is this
I've found all I've waited for, yeah
And I could not ask for more

[Bridge]
I could not ask for more than this time together
Could not ask for more than this time with you
Every prayer has been answered
Every dream I've had's come true
Yeah, right here in this moment
Is right where I'm meant to be
Here with you, here with me, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
These are the moments I thank God that I'm alive
These are the moments I'll remember all my life
I've found all I've waited for, yeah
And I could not ask for more

[Bridge]
I could not ask for more than this time together
Could not ask for more than this time with you
Every prayer has been answered
Every dream I've had's come true
Yeah, right here in this moment
Is right where I'm meant to be
Oh, here with you, here with me

[Outro]
No, I could not ask for more than this love you gave me
'Cause it's all I've waited for
And I could not ask for more
No, yeah, yeah
No, I could not ask for more
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
