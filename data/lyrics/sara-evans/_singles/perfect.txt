[Verse 1]
If you don't take me to Paris
On a lover's getaway
It's alright, it's alright
If I'd rather wear your T-shirt
Than a sexy negligee
It's alright, it's alright
Every dinner doesn't have to be candlelit
It's kinda nice to know that it doesn't have to be

[Chorus]
Perfect
Baby, every little piece of the puzzle doesn't always fit
Perfectly
Love can be rough around the edges
Tattered at the seams
Honey, if it's good enough for you
It's good enough for me

[Verse 2]
If your mother doesn't like the way I treat her baby boy
It's alright, it's alright
If in every wedding picture, my daddy looks annoyed
It's alright, it's alright
Don't you know that all the fairy tales tell a lie?
Real love and real life doesn't have to be

[Chorus]
Perfect
Baby, every little piece of the puzzle doesn't always fit
Perfectly
Love can be rough around the edges
Tattered at the seams
Honey, if it's good enough for you
It's good enough for me

[Bridge]
Oh, you don't mind if I show up late for everything
When you lose your cool, it's kinda cute to me
Ain't it nice to know that we don't have to be

[Chorus]
Perfect?
Baby, every little piece of the puzzle doesn't always fit
Perfectly
Love can be rough around the edges
Tattered at the seams
Honey, if it's good enough for you
It's good enough for me

[Outro]
Oh, it's good enough for me (Perfect)
Yeah, good enough for me (Perfect)
Oh, you're good enough for me (Perfect)
