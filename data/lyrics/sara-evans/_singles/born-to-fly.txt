[Verse 1]
I've been tellin' my dreams to the scarecrow
About the places that I'd like to see
I said, "Friend, do you think I'll ever get there?"
Oh, but he just stands there, smilin' back at me
So I confess my sins to the preacher
About the love I've been prayin' to find
"Is there a brown eyed boy in my future?" Yeah
An' he says, "Girl, you've got nothin' but time"

[Chorus]
But how do you wait for heaven?
And who has that much time?
And how do you keep your feet on the ground when you know
That you were born
You were born to fly?

[Verse 2]
My daddy, he is grounded like the oak tree
My momma, she is steady as the sun
Oh, you know I love my folks, but I keep starin' down the road
Just lookin' for my one chance to run
Hey, 'cause I will soar away like the blackbird
I will blow in the wind like a seed
I will plant my heart in the garden of my dreams
And I will grow up where I'll wander wild and free

[Chorus]
Oh, how do you wait for heaven?
And who has that much time?
And how do you keep your feet on the ground when you know
That you were born
You were born, yeah
You were born to fly?

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
So, how do you wait for heaven?
And who has that much time?
And how do you keep your feet on the ground when you know
That you were born
You were born to fly?
Yeah
You were born to fly, fly, fly, fly

[Post-Chorus]
Hey
Ooh, ooh

[Instrumental Outro]
