[Verse 1]
I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?
I've been put down
I've been pushed 'round
When will I be loved?

[Refrain]
When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time

[Verse 2]
I've been made blue
I've been lied to
When will I be loved?

[Refrain]
When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time

[Verse 3]
Oh, I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?

[Outro]
When will I be loved?
Tell me, when will I be loved?
