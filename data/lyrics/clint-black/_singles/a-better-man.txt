[Verse 1]
What do you say when it's over?
I don't know if I should say anything at all
One day we're rollin' in the clover
Next thing you know, we take the fall

[Verse 2]
Still, I think about the years since I first met you
And the way it might have been without you here
I don't know if words from me can still upset you
But I've just gotta make this memory stand clear

[Chorus]
I know I'm leavin' here a better man
For knowing you this way
Things I couldn't do before now I think I can
And I'm leavin' here a better man

[Verse 3]
I guess, I always knew I couldn't hold you
But I'd never be the one to set you free
Just like some old nursery rhyme your Mama told you
You still believe in some old meant-to-be

[Chorus]
Still, I'm leavin' here a better man
For knowing you this way
Things I couldn't do before now I think I can
And I'm leavin' here a better man
Yes, I'm leavin' here a better man
For knowing you this way
Things I couldn't do before now I know I can
And I'm leavin' here a better man

[Outro]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yes, I'm leavin' here a better man
