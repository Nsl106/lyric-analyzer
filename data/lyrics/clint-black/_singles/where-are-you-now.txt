[Verse 1]
Maybe I took for granted you'd be around
To pick me up on my way down
I thought my feet were planted firmly on the ground
'Til one day my whole world came unwound

[Verse 2]
Like a ball of yarn kept neatly on a spool
You held the life together of this broken hearted fool
And what was once the exception now seems to be the rule

[Chorus]
There's a burning question afire in my mind
You always had the answers to the ones I couldn't find
So all I'm asking is, where are you now?

[Verse 3]
What Father Time would sell me, I'd take it all if only you'd be back around
But then if time should spell me I might take the call, but there's no way of knowing where I'm bound

[Verse 4]
So here it comes, another fine mess I've got into
And if I knew which way to turn I'd still turn to you
So if everything is said and done, what am I supposed to do?

[Chorus]
That's the burning question, on fire in my mind
You always had the answers for me, time after time
So all I'm asking is, where are you now?

[Outro]
All I'm asking is, where are you now?
