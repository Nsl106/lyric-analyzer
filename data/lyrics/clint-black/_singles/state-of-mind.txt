[Verse 1]
Got a big leather suitcase, all I own's inside
Seems I've been walkin' for days, can't even bum a ride
Try steppin' to a tune, with the rhythm of a walkin' man
Mind drifts like a big balloon out of my situation at hand

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how a melody can bring back the memory
Take you to another place in time
Completely change your state of mind

[Verse 2]
Walkin' down a lonely highway not feelin' alone
Thinkin' back when things went my way and not the road I'm on
Well, I've been down a time or two, but it never lasts long
I can always make it through on a wing and a prayer and a song

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how a melody can bring back the memory
Take you to another place in time
Completely change your state of mind

[Bridge]
It can make a right from a wrong, it can make you fall in love
It can get you singin' along
Chase the clouds away and make the sun shine above

[Chorus]
A melody can bring back a memory
Take you to another place in time
Completely change your state of mind
A melody can bring back a memory
Take you to another place in time
Completely change your state of mind
