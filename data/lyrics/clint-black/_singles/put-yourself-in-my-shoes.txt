[Verse 1]
Your mind is made up, you won't even try, you didn't even cry this time
You say that we could never see eye to eye and one of us just must be blind

[Pre-Chorus]
We have our differences, we're still the same, see what we want to see
But you take a second look and maybe things wouldn't seem the same if you could see what you mean to me

[Chorus]
Put yourself in my shoes, walk a mile for me
I'll put myself in your shoes, maybe then we'd see
That if you put yourself in my shoes, you'd have some sympathy
And if I could only put myself in your shoes, I'd walk right back to me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You're gonna keep walkin' and you're gonna pass me by, you say you don't even care
But I could always recognize a real goodbye and I know your heart's not there

[Pre-Chorus]
We've had our differences, we're still the same, hear what we wanna hear
Now I'm head over heels in the lost and found, it's a cryin' shame, I thought we made the perfect pair

[Chorus]
Put yourself in my shoes, walk a while, walk that mile for me
I'll put myself in your shoes, maybe then we'd see
That if you put yourself in my shoes, you'd have some sympathy
And if I could only put myself in your shoes, I'd walk right back to me

[Outro]
I'd walk right back to me
I'd walk right back to me
