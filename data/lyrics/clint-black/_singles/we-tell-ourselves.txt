[Verse 1]
I oughta know the look in another's eyes
When there's something on their mind
I think I saw that look in a lover's eyes
They were looking into mine
Like we both had found the one we want
But found the one we wanted just quit trying

[Chorus]
So we tell ourselves
That what we found is what we meant to find
That's what we tell ourselves
You won't believe the things a heart could tell a mind
Somehow we sell ourselves on love
I just don't think I'll believe my heart this time

[Verse 2]
I oughta know the language well
I've heard me tell myself these things before
I finally made my mind up
My heart tells me to look for something more
Determined not to wind up wondering
"Was she the one?" Well, you never can be sure

[Chorus]
So we tell ourselves
That what we found is what we meant to find
That's what we tell ourselves
You won't believe the things a heart could tell a mind
Somehow we sell ourselves on love
I just don't think I'll believe my heart this time

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Yeah, we tell ourselves
That what we found is what we meant to find
That's what we tell ourselves
You won't believe the things a heart could tell a mind
Somehow we sell ourselves on love
I just don't think I'll believe my heart this time
