[Verse 1: Clint Black]
These times are trouble and these times are good
They're always gonna be, they rise and they fall
We take 'em all the way that we should
Together, you and me forsaking them all
Deep in the night and by the light of day
It always looks the same, true love always does
Here by your side or a million miles away
Nothin' is ever gonna change the way I feel
The way it is, is the way that it was

[Chorus: Clint Black & Lisa Hartman Black]
When I said "I do," I meant that I will
'Til the end of all time
Be faithful and true, devoted to you
That's what I had in mind when I said "I do"

[Verse 2: Clint Black, Both & Lisa Hartman Black]
Well this whole world keeps changin' and the world stays the same
For all who came before and it goes hand in hand
Only you and I can undo all that we became
That makes us so much more (So much more)
Than a woman and a man
After everything that comes and goes around
Has only passed us by
Here alone in our dreams
I know there's a lonely heart in every lost and found
But, forever, you and I will be the ones
Who found out what forever means

[Chorus: Clint Black & Lisa Hartman Black]
When I said "I do," I meant that I will
'Til the end of all time
Be faithful and true, devoted to you
That's what I had in mind when I said, "I do"

[Outro: Clint Black, Both & Lisa Hartman Black]
Truer than true
You know that I'll always be there for you
That's what I had in mind
That's what I had in mind
When I said "I do"
