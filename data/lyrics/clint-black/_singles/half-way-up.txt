[Verse 1]
I've seen it going around when you get bad news
Thinking that you found a darker shade of blues
Looking for the light and it's a long way back
You know without a fight you're gonna fade to black
Never was a man that ever felt this way
One who couldn't stand to live another day
Hard times seem to have the corner on you
But you can rise from the ashes too

[Chorus]
When I'm on my knees and everything has gotten me beat
And even I believe I'm never gonna find my feet
Two ways you can go, you can ask anybody around
One man's halfway up is another man's halfway down

[Verse 2]
Now you may decide it's a losing game
Even in your stride, you're gonna call it lame
Getting one leg up when it's said and done
Is the hardest part no matter how you run
If you can walk away from a crash and burn
You'll appreciate every step you earn
And if you feel the ground is gaining on you
You're already bound to take a different view

[Chorus]
When I'm on my knees and everything has gotten me beat
And even I believe I'm never gonna find my feet
Two ways you can go, you can ask anybody around
One man's halfway up is another man's halfway down

[Bridge]
One man's ceiling is another man's floor
One man's wall could be another man's door
One man's smile is another man's frown
And there are miles of halfway up or halfway down

[Outro]
Halfway up
Halfway up, halfway down
