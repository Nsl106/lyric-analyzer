[Verse 1]
We've all seen enough wrong and right
To know everything's not black and white
There's always somethin' in-between
No matter how long or well you live
You don't get anything you don't give
Still, no slate is clean

[Pre-Chorus]
For better or worse, anybody can
Take a look around and find a better man
Upright no matter how he's farin'
No matter what kind of shoes he's wearin'

[Chorus]
The shoes he's wearin'
They don't make the man

[Verse 2]
So many people out runnin' around
Handicapped before they hit the ground
Thinkin' there's nowhere to go
Shouldn't we all be lookin' for ways
To keep on seein' our better days?
We're not chained to what we know

[Pre-Chorus]
But if your eyes are open and your mind is free
There's no tellin' what a man can be
Upright no matter how you're farin'
No matter what kind of shoes you're wearin'

[Chorus]
The shoes you're wearin'
They don't make the man

[Bridge]
But if you can't walk through the
Best of times and the worst of times
Find your feet, still walkin' the line
You'll never carry the load worth bearin'
No matter what kind of shoes you're wearin'

[Chorus]
The shoes you're wearin' (Shoes)
They don't make the man
The shoes you're wearin' (Shoes)
They won't make the man

[Outro]
Shoes
Don't make the man
Shoes
Won't make the man
Shoes
Don't make the man
Shoes
Don't make the man
