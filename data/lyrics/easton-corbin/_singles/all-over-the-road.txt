[Verse 1]
No sir I ain't been drinking
I ain't even had one beer
This sweet thing's got me buzzin'
From whispering in my ear
Just take a peek up in here
At this little hot mess
Mister, you'll understand
I'm doing my best

[Chorus]
And I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When she's all over me, I'm all outta control
All over the road

[Verse 3]
Don't wanna get no ticket
Don't wanna 'cause no wreck
It's hard to concentrate with her pretty little lips on my neck
I say "Girl take it easy"
She laughs, says "It'll be fine"
How am I supposed to keep it between the lines?

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When she's all over me, I'm all outta control
And all over the road

[Bridge]
Something 'bout these wheels rolling
Radio playing gets her going
I'm trying to get her home as fast as I can go

[Chorus]
And I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
Have a little mercy on me
Sir I'm sorry I know
I'm all over the road
All over the road
All over the road
