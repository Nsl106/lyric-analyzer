[Verse 1]
There were trains and we out-run 'em
There were songs and we out-sung 'em
There were brighter days never ending
There was time and we were burnin'
There were rhymes and we were learnin'
There was all the love two hearts could hold

[Chorus 1]
And after all this time
You're always on my mind
Hey I could never let it end
'Cause my heart takes so long to mend
The dream that keeps your hopes alive
The lonely nights you hold inside
And after all this time
You're always on my mind
I still want you

[Verse 2]
There was rain that we outlasted
There was pain, but we got past it
There were last goodbyes still left unspoken
There were ways I should have thrilled you
There were days when I could have killed you
You're the only love my life has known

[Chorus 2]
And after all this time
You're always on my mind
Hey I could never let you go
A broken heart that heals so slow
Could never beat for someone new
While you're alive and I am too
And after all this time
You're always on my mind
I still miss you

[Outro]
And I could never let it in
'Cause my heart takes so long to mend
The dream that keeps your hopes alive
The lonely nights you hold inside
And after all this time
You're always on my mind
I still want you
Hey after all this time
You're always on my mind
I still love you
