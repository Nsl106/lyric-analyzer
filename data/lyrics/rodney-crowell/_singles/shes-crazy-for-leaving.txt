Well the bus pulled away
In a roaring black cloud
Well I stood in the road
And Honey I hollered right out loud

Hey darling I love ya
Hey bus driver whoa!
But you can't stop a women when she's out of control

She's crazy for leaving!
I told her so!
And the boys at the bus stop just said "man, let her go!"
She's crazy for leaving
I told her so!
But you can't stop a women when she's out of control

So I punched out my truck on a telephone pole!
No. she never looked back she just said "go driver go!"
Well I know I could a caught her
But I ran outta luck!
She was long on to Lufkin by the time they cut me out of my truck

She's crazy for leaving
I told her so!
And the boys at the bus stop just said "man, let her go!"
She's crazy for leaving I told her so
But you can't stop a women when she's out of control

So I kicked and I cussed that old East Texas road
I throw'd rocks at my truck, which had busted my nose
Ya add insult to injury and what do ya get?
Ya get a bus stop of honkies that don't ever forget!

She's crazy for leaving I told her so
And the bus depot lady just said "Hun, just let her go!"
She's crazy for leaving I told her so!
But you can't stop a women when she's out of control
No, you can't stop a women when she's out of control

Ya know, she's probably already to Little Rock
