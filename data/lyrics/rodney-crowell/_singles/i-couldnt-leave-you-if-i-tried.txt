[Verse 1]
The sun is coming up and I'm just going down
Everywhere I look, the world keeps turning round
And though I said I never would be satisfied
Baby I lied, I couldn't leave you if I tried

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I get lost out on this sad old town
And every bridge I cross just turns me upside down
And every stumbling step I take back to your side
Hurts my pride, I couldn't leave you if I tried

[Bridge 1]
Well, I could not walk away
No matter what I say
I won't be leaving, believe it or don't
You're all that I want

[Verse 3]
Tears may fall but after all is said and done
Darling, please believe me you're the only one
And I'll admit mistakes have made me realize
Baby I lied, I couldn't leave you if I tried

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge 2]
I won't be leaving you
No matter what I do
I'm gonna see it through to the end
And do it again

[Verse 4]
Years may come and friends may go but that's ok
Darling, you're the only one I need to stay
I know I said I never would be satisfied
Baby I lied, I couldn't leave you if I tried
