Yes I had a woman love me gave her what there was there of me
It was good as it could be
Then I heard a wild world calling, I saw a lone star falling
Caught a song and set it free
Many a long and lonesome highway lies before us as we go
In the end I'll do it my way
Look for me where the four winds blow
I believe in love and danger
I believe that truth is stranger
I believe that fear is much too strong
I believe the best will find me when I leave the rest behind me
Out on the highway I'm on my own
Every night's a new beginning every day the world keeps spinning
Sometimes it's hard to stand upon my own
To the east the moon comes showing to the west the storm clouds growing
Though by myself I'm not alone
My father on his deathbed told me there's really nothing left to hold me
Though I was there he died alone
It's gonna take a fast train leaving to shake my world of grieving
Guess I'll go until it's gone
Many a long and lonesome highway lies before us as we go
In the end I'll do it my way look for me where the four winds blow
