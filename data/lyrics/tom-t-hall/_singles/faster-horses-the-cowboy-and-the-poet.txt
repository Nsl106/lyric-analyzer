[Verse 1]
He was an old time cowboy, don't you understand?
His eyes were sharp as razor blades, his face was leather tanned
His toes were pointed inward from a-hangin' on a horse
He was an old philosopher of course
He was so thin I swear you could have used him for a whip
He had to drink a beer to keep his breeches on his hips
I knew I had to ask him about the mysteries of life
He spat between his boots and he replied

[Chorus]
"It's faster horses
Younger women
Older whiskey
More money"

[Verse 2]
He smiled and all his teeth were covered with tobacco stains
He said, "It don't do men no good to pray for peace and rain"
"Peace and rain is just a way to say prosperity
And buffalo chips is all that means to me"
I told him I was a poet, I was lookin' for the truth
I do not care for horses, whiskey, women or the loot
I said I was a writer, my soul was all on fire
He looked at me and he said, "You are a liar"

[Chorus]
"Son, it's faster horses
Younger women
Older whiskey
More money"

[Verse 3]
Well, I was disillusioned, if I say the least
I grabbed him by the collar and I jerked him to his feet
There was somethin' cold and shiny laying by my head
So I started to believe the things he said
Well, my poet days are over and I'm back to bein' me
As I enjoy the peace and comfort of reality
If my boy ever asks me what it is that I have learned
I think that I will readily affirm

[Chorus]
"Son, it's faster horses
Younger women
Older whiskey
More money"

[Chorus][x3]
Faster horses
Younger women
Older whiskey
More money
