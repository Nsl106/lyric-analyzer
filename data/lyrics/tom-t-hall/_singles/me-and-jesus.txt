[Chorus]
Well, me and Jesus got our own thing going
Me and Jesus got it all worked out
Me and Jesus got our own thing going
We don't need anybody to tell us what it's all about

[Verse 1]
I know a man who once was a sinner
I know a man that once was a drunk
I know a man who once was a loser
But he went out one day and made an altar out of a stump

[Chorus]
Me and Jesus got our own thing going
Me and Jesus got it all worked out
Me and Jesus got our own thing going
We don't need anybody to tell us what it's all about

[Verse 2]
Jesus brought me through all of my troubles
Jesus brought me through all of my trials
Jesus brought me through all of my heartaches
And I know that Jesus ain't gonna forsake me now

[Chorus]
Well, me and Jesus got our own thing going
Me and Jesus got it all worked out
Me and Jesus got our own thing going
We don't need anybody to tell us what it's all about

[Verse 3]
We can't afford any fancy preaching
We can't afford any fancy church
We can't afford any fancy singing
But you know Jesus got a lot of poor people out doing his work

[Chorus]
Well, me and Jesus got our own thing going
Me and Jesus got it all worked out
Me and Jesus got our own thing going
We don't need anybody to tell us what it's all about

[Outro]
Me and Jesus got our own thing going
Me and Jesus got it all worked out
Me and Jesus got our own thing going
