[Verse 1]
Real men love women
Fast cars and livin'
Out on the edge so far
They're gonna need forgivin'
Real men like football
Cowboys and outlaws
Can't help but fly so high
It's gonna hurt to fall

[Chorus]
Like Saturday nights out on the town
Sunday morning coming down
A pretty girl out on the dance floor spinnin'
Round and round and round they go
Cold beer and a dirty hand
Calling home every chance they can
To say I love you
They don’t need a reason

[Verse 2]
Real men love Jesus
And they love mama
If they can get more than forty hours
You know they gonna
They give it hell 'til they get it right
The kind every country girl's tryin' to find
Every girl's daddy's kinda guy
Ain't scared to pray, ain't scared to fight

[Chorus]
They like Saturday nights out on the town
Sunday morning coming down
A pretty girl out on the dance floor spinnin'
Round and round and round they go
Cold beer and a dirty hand
Calling home every chance they can
To say I love you
They don't need a reason
Real men love Jesus

[Bridge]
Real men love Jesus
They don't believe in leavin'
When the goin' gets tough
They just keep on keepin'

[Chorus]
They like Saturday nights out on the town
Sunday morning coming down
A pretty girl out on the dance floor spinnin'
Round and round and round they go
Cold beer and a dirty hand
Calling home every chance they can
To say I love you
They don't need a reason
Real men love Jesus
Real men love Jesus
