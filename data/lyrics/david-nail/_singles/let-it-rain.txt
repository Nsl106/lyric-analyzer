[Verse 1: David Nail]
It's hard to find the perfect time to say something
You know is gonna change everything
Living with the shame, it ain't nothing like the pain that I saw on her face
Now me and my pile of things
That she threw out the window
Drowning next to me
No seven years of good can't hide the one night I forgot to wear that ring

[Chorus: David Nail and Sarah Buxton]
So let it rain, let it pour, if she don't love me anymore
Just let it come down on me (let it come down on me) , let it come down on me (let it come down on me)
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve
Let it come down on me (let it come down on me), let it come down on me (let it come down on me), let it rain

[Verse 2: David Nail and David Nail and Sarah Buxton ]
Last thing I remember was the unfamiliar taste of someone on my lips
It's too late to turn around
When the shades start coming down
The guilt you feel is the last thing on your mind

[Chorus: David Nail and Sarah Buxton]
So let it rain, let it pour, if she don't love me anymore (you don't love me anymore)
Just let it come down on me (let it come down on me), let it come down on me (let it come down on me)
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve (even more)
Just let it come down on me (let it come down on me), let it come down on me (let it come down on me)
Let it rain

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: David Nail,  Sarah Buxton and David Nail and Sarah Buxton ]
So let it rain, let it pour, if she don't love me anymore
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve (even more baby) , just let it come down on me  (let it come down on me)
Let it come down on me  (let it come down on me), let it rain  (you don't love me anymore)
Ooh let it rain  (let it come down on me), ooh let it rain, just let it rain, just let it rain, ooh let it rain
