[Verse 1]
A cup of coffee with the first sunlight
At a last chance Texaco
I'm thumbin' through a worn-out road map
Tryin' to decide which way to go
These empty miles and her memory
They just seem to linger on
She left me on this lost highway
Wonderin' why and where she's gone

[Chorus]
That's how a cowgirl breaks a young man's heart
That's how my whole world slowly came apart
With a cold and empty stare, as if I wasn't there
She didn't even stop to cry
That's how a cowgirl says goodbye

[Verse 2]
Called up her mama in Abilene
Just to find out how she'd been
Said she'd stopped a while in San Antone
To spend some time with an old friend
With all this distance in between us
I'm sure I never cross her mind
And it may take all these roads ahead
Just to leave it all behind

[Chorus]
That's how a cowgirl breaks a young man's heart
That's how my whole world slowly came apart
With a cold and empty stare, as if I wasn't there
She didn't even stop to cry
That's how a cowgirl says goodbye

[Chorus]
That's how a cowgirl breaks a young man's heart
That's how my whole world slowly came apart
With a cold and empty stare, as if I wasn't there
She didn't even stop to cry
That's how a cowgirl says goodbye
