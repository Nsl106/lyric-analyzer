[Verse 1]
What would you say if I told you "I'm sorry"?
And that I've come to realize, life means nothin' without you
Would you take my hand, would you forgive this man, for ever doubtin' your love was true?
And could you find it in your heart to let me try and make it up to you

[Chorus]
Yesterday a jealous man
Today a lonely fool
I let love slip right through my hands
From all the hurt I've handed you
I've gotta stop your love from dyin'
Or I'll be livin' proof
That yesterday's jealous man
Is today's lonely fool

[Verse 2]
Darlin', from now on I'll be proud when other men notice you
Instead of gettin' mean and loud, like I used to do
Find some mercy in your heart, then will make another start, at the love that we once new
I won't hurt you anymore, I'm gonna trust you now and never question you

[Chorus]
Yesterday a jealous man
Today a lonely fool
I let love slip right through my hands
From all the hurt I've handed you
I've gotta stop your love from dyin'
Or I'll be livin' proof
That yesterday's jealous man
Is today's lonely fool

[Outro]
I'm today's lonely fool
Today's lonely fool
