[Verse 1]
It was where my mama sat on
That old swing with her crochet
It was where granddaddy taught me
How to cuss and how to pray
It was where we made our own ice cream
Those sultry summer nights
Where the bulldog had her puppies
And us brothers had our fights

[Verse 2]
There were many nights I'd sit right there
And look out at the stars
To the sound of a distant whippoorwill
Or the hum of a passing car
It was where I first got up the nerve
To steal me my first kiss
And it was where I learned to play guitar
And pray I had the gift

[Chorus]
If the world had a front porch like we did back then
We'd still have our problems, but we'd all be friends
Treating your neighbor like he's your next of kin
Wouldn't be gone with the wind
If the world had a front porch like we did back then

[Verse 3]
Purple hulls and pintos
I've shelled more than my share
As lightning bugs and crickets
Danced in the evening air
And like a beacon that old yellow bulb
It always led me home
Somehow Mama always knew
Just when to leave it on

[Chorus]
If the world had a front porch like we did back then
We'd still have our problems, but we'd all be friends
Treating your neighbor like he's your next of kin
Wouldn't be gone with the wind
If the world had a front porch like we did back then

[Outro]
Treating your neighbor like he's your next of kin
Wouldn't be gone with the wind
If the world had a front porch like we did back then
