[Verse 1]
Last thing I expected
Was to get her call tonight
'Cause the last thing that I heard from her
Was she found "Mr. Right"
But when I came home this evenin'
There it was on my machine
And I'm just wonderin'
What the hell it means

[Chorus]
Said she's sorry, that she missed me
And she's been doin' fine
I've run it back and heard her say
Those words a hundred times
Somethin' makes me wonder
Is she happy with her choice?
Or is that a tear I hear
In her voice?

[Verse 2]
First time that I listened
I thought boy she's got some nerve
But the second time I heard it
I heard more than just her words
Am I just wishful thinkin'
Or did her voice really crack?
I'll never know
If I don't call her back

[Chorus]
Said she's sorry, that she missed me
And she's been doin' fine
I've run it back and heard her say
Those words a hundred times
Somethin' makes me wonder
Is she happy with her choice?
Or is that a tear I hear
In her voice?

[Outro]
Oh, is that a tear
Lord, is that a tear I hear
In her voice
