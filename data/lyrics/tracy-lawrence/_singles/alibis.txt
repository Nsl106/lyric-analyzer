[Verse 1]
She knows every move that a man could make
She knows every trick in the book
She knows how to give, she knows how to take
But so many times, she's been taken a fool

[Chorus]
By those alibis and lyin' eyes and all the best lines
Lord knows she's heard 'em all
She's been cheated on and pushed around and left alone
Lord knows what I've put her through
And, boy, you can bet, if a move can be made
She knows how to make one on you

[Verse 2]
She once thought that love wasn't just a game
Her feelings once came from the heart
But one day, I gave her a wedding ring
And one night, I tore all those feelings apart

[Chorus]
With my alibis and lyin' eyes and all the best lines
Lord knows she's heard 'em all
She's been cheated on and pushed around and left alone
Lord knows what I've put her through
And, boy, you can bet, if a move can be made
She knows how to make
Her own alibis and lyin' eyes and all the best lines
Lord knows she's heard 'em all
She's been cheated on and pushed around and left alone
Lord knows what I've put her through
And, boy, you can bet, if a move can be made
She knows how to make one on you
