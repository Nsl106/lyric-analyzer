[Verse 1]
You can take the house and everything in it
Keep the diamond ring 'cause that's how I meant it
Sticks and stones are all they ever were to me
This material life with all its value
Don't mean a thing to me without you
The love that we once had is all I need

[Pre-Chorus]
So take everything we have if it makes you happy
But, darlin', let me say before I leave

[Chorus]
These sticks and stones ain't all that makes a home
They don't have arms to hold you when love goes wrong
Now you say we are through
These sticks and stones may break me
But the words you said just tore my heart in two

[Verse 2]
Remember when we didn't have a dime between us
You took my hand and said we don't need much
Just as long as we're together, we would be fine
Now we've acquired all I thought would please you
I gave everything you know that I could
And still you're tellin' me you're not satisfied

[Pre-Chorus]
So take everything we have if it makes you happy
But, darlin', let me say before I leave

[Chorus]
These sticks and stones ain't all that makes a home
They don't have arms to hold you when love goes wrong
Now you say we are through
These sticks and stones may break me
But the words you said just tore my heart in two

[Outro]
These sticks and stones may break me
But the words you said just tore my heart in two
