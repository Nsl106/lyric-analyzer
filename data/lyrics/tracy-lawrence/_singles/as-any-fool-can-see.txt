[Verse 1]
Lately, she's been pickin' fights
Droppin' hints and just last night
I caught a tear as she slipped off to sleep
She's not here, but she's not gone
I guess she must be waitin' on
The kind of man I promised her I'd be

[Chorus]
As any fool can see, she's gonna cross that line
She's got leavin' on her mind
And it's too late, but what keeps killin' me
Is knowin' I've been blind as any fool can see

[Verse 2]
How long did I think she'd stand
For me to be the kind of man
That came and went just as I dang well pleased?
While she sits at home alone
With fears and feelings of her own
Lord knows goodbye would bring me to my knees

[Chorus]
As any fool can see, she's gonna cross that line
She's got leavin' on her mind
And it's too late, but what keeps killin' me
Is knowin' I've been blind

[Chorus]
As any fool can see, she's gonna cross that line
She's got leavin' on her mind
And it's too late, but what keeps killin' me
Is knowin' I've been blind
As any fool can see, she's gonna cross that line
She's got leavin' on her mind
And it's too late, but what keeps killin' me
Is knowin' I've been blind as any fool can see
