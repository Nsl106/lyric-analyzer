It was Sunday mornin' I was seven years old
In the backyard playin' in a big mud hole
I was all decked out, ready for church
Had my brand new suit all covered in dirt

Mama hit the ceiling, she was fit to be tied
Talking 'bout how she's gonna tan my hide
But daddy was laughing when I changed my clothes
Saying mama leave the boy alone

'Cause if the good die young
If the good die young
Our little boy's gonna have a lot of fun
'Cause he's gonna live forever if the good die young

Ten years later had a hot-rod Ford
Constable clocked me at a hundred and four
Judge said boy you're gonna hurt yourself
You'd a long been dead if you was anybody else

'Cause if the good die young
Yeah, if the good die young
Oh, there ain't a sentence gonna hold you son
'Cause your gonna live forever if the good die young"

Well I got a good heart, I wouldn't hurt a soul
But I'm gonna keep rocking 'til they call that roll
Old St. Peter's gonna have to wait
I'm gonna go to Heaven but I might be late

'Cause if the good die young
Lord if the good die young
Pedal to the metal, let your motor run
'Cause I'm gonna live forever if the good die young

And if the good die young
Lordy if the good die young
Take out the jams, we'll have some fun
'Cause I'm gonna live forever if the good die young

I'm gonna live forever if the good die young
