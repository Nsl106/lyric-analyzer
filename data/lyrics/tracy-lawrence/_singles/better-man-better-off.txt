[Verse 1]
The hardest thing I'll ever do
Is to walk away still loving you
I'd give anything if you loved me
But some things just ain't meant to be
Can't say it's all been time lost, but in the long run
I'll be a better man, better off

[Chorus]
Gonna find my pride, self esteem
Get on with my life, follow my dreams, ain't lookin back
Learn from my mistakes once I'm past this heartache
I know when the hurting stops, I'll be a better man, better off

[Verse 2]
I know Rome wasn't built in a day
But there's a lot of good memories in my way
And if I had it all to do over again
I wouldn't change a thing, except for the end
Gonna be some pain, gotta pay the cost
But in the long run, I'll be a better man, better off

[Chorus]
Gonna find my pride, self esteem
Get on with my life, follow my dreams, ain't lookin back
Learn from my mistakes once I'm past this heartache
I know when the hurting stops, I'll be a better man, better off

[Outro]
I'm gonna learn from my mistakes once I'm past the heartache
I know when the hurting stops, I'll be a better man, better off
A whole lot better off
A better man, better off
