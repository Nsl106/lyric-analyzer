[Verse 1]
I never felt as helpless as I do today
My world just fell around me
As I watched you drive away
There's nothin' left between us
Somehow we've grown apart
'Cause I've got it through my head
I just can't break it to my heart

[Chorus]
I can't believe this is me
On the hurtin' side of pain
Siftin' through the ashes
Still tryin' to find a flame
But the flame has turned to embers
Left glowin' in the dark
I've got it through my head
I just can't break it to my heart

[Verse 2]
If I could, Lord knows I would
Spin back the hands of time
And piece these scattered memories
That are cluttered in my mind
Pick up where we left off
And make a brand new start
'Cause I've got it through my head
I just can't break it to my heart

[Chorus]
I can't believe this is me
On the hurtin' side of pain
Siftin' through the ashes
Still tryin' to find a flame
But the flame has turned to embers
Left glowin' in the dark
I've got it through my head
I just can't break it to my heart

[Tag]
Oh, I've got it through my head
I just can't break it to my heart
I just can't, I just can't break it to my heart
I just can't, I just can't break it to my heart...
