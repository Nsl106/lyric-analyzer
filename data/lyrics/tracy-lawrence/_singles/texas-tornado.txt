[Verse 1]
You called me up from Amarillo
Said you were comin' to town
And thought I'd like to tell you hello
And drive an old friend around
I pulled up to the airport
Confident and cool
But when you stepped off that plane
I knew I was your fool

[Chorus]
My little Texas tornado
Blowin' me away again
I swore it wouldn't happen again
But I looked at you and then
I'm like a tumbleweed
In a wild west Texas wind
You're blowin' me away
Again

[Verse 2]
You're lyin' with me in Atlanta
It's such a beautiful lie
You play me like a piano
I always let you get by
I know I'll go through hell, girl
When you find someone else
But right now I'm in heaven
And I can't help myself

[Chorus]
My little Texas tornado
Blowin' me away again
I swore it wouldn't happen again
But I looked at you and then
I'm like a tumbleweed
In a wild west Texas wind
You're blowin' me away
Again

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
I'm like a tumbleweed
In a wild west Texas wind
You're blowin' me away
Texas tornado
Blowin' me away again
I swore it wouldn't happen again
But I looked at you and then
I'm like a tumbleweed
In a wild west Texas wind
You're blowin' me away
Texas tornado
Blowin' me away again
