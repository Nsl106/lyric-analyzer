[Verse 1]
Sister cries out from her baby bed
Brother runs in, feathers on his head
Mama's in her room, learnin' how to sew
Daddy's drinkin' beer, listenin' to the radio
Hank Williams sings "Kaw-Liga" and "Dear John"
Time marches on, time marches on

[Verse 2]
Now sister's usin' rouge and clear complexion soap
Brother's wearin' beads and he smokes a lot of dope
Mama is depressed, barely makes a sound
Daddy's got a girlfriend in another town
Bob Dylan sings "Like a Rolling Stone"
And time marches on, time marches on

[Bridge]
The South moves north, the North moves south
A star is born, a star burns out
The only thing that stays the same is
Everything changes, everything changes

[Verse 3]
Now sister calls herself a sexy grandma
Brother's on a diet for high cholesterol
Mama's out of touch with reality
Daddy's in the ground beneath the maple tree
As the angels sing an old Hank Williams song
Time marches on, time marches on
Time marches on, time marches on
Yeah, time marches on, time marches on
