[Verse 1]
I see the way he doesn't treat you right
I see the tears that you try to hide
I feel the heartache that you don't show
I wish I had a way to let you know

[Chorus]
I would be the shoulder you could cry on
The heart and soul you know you could rely on
With every breath I'll ever take
I swear I'll never let forever end
If you loved me
If you loved me again

[Verse 2]
There was a time I had it all with you
'Til it came undone, from what I didn't do
Now he's making the same mistakes
And when he loses you, if it's not too late

[Chorus]
I would be the shoulder you could cry on
The heart and soul you know you could rely on
With every breath I'll ever take
I swear I'll never let forever end
If you loved me
If you loved me again

[Outro]
With every breath I'll ever take
I swear I'll never let forever end
If you loved me
If you loved me again
