[Verse 1]
When the last breath of life
Is gone from my body
And my lips are as cold as the sea
When my friends gather 'round
For my farewell party
Won't you pretend you love me?

[Chorus]
There'll be flowers from those
Who cry when I go
And leave you in this world alone
I know you'll have fun
At my farewell party
I know you'll be glad when I'm gone

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Don't be mad at me
For wanting to keep you
'Til my life on this old world is through
You'll be free at the end
Of my farewell party
But I'll go away loving you

[Chorus]
There'll be flowers from those
Who cry when I go
And leave you in this old world alone
I know you'll have fun
At my farewell party
I know you'll be glad when I'm gone

[Outro]
Oh, I know you'll be glad when I'm gone
