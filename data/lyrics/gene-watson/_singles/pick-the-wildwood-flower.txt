[Verse 1]
Them Texas fields were hot and that tractor never was my kinda living
And when I hit sixteen, I had the size and I hit the road to freedom
And I'm glad I wasn't there to see my mama 'cause she must have cried for hours
I still hear her saying, "Gary, get your guitar, pick the Wildwood Flower"

[Verse 2]
Now, Dallas, it was big and hard to find a job and so I didn't
It was easier to hitch a ride to Houston and it was more like living
Now, I've been down every road and I've stood on every porch where they were giving
And if they had an hour or a dime, I would pick the Wildwood Flower

[Verse 3]
It's hard to turn around and look back down the roads that I have traveled
'cause like a never-ending ball of twine, my dreams have come unravelled
And now as evening lays its shawl across the shoulders of my life, I have to find
I couldn't tie my life together with guitar strings and a poet's heartfelt line

[Outro]
And I'm so glad I wasn't there to see my mama 'cause she must have cried for hours
I still hear her saying, "Gary, get your guitar and pick the Wildwood Flower"
