[Verse 1]
From somewhere outside, I hear the street vendor cry "filé gumbo"
From my window, I see him going down the street and he don't know
That she fell right to sleep in the damp, tangled sheets so soon
After love in the hot afternoon

[Chorus]
Now, the Bourbon Street lady sleeps like a baby in the shadows (in the shadows)
She was new to me, full of mystery, but now I know (I know)
That she's just a girl and I'm just a guy in a room
For love in the hot afternoon

[Verse 2]
We got high in the park this morning and we sat without talking
Then we came back here in the heat of the day, tired of walking
Where under her breath, she hummed to herself, a tune
Of love in the hot afternoon

[Chorus]
Now, the Bourbon Street lady sleeps like a baby in the shadows (in the shadows)
She was new to me, full of mystery, but now I know (I know)
That she's just a girl and I'm just a guy in a room
For love in the hot afternoon
