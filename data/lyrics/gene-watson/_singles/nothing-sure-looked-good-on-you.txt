[Verse 1]
You found your greener pasture in a mansion on a hill
With a flashy foreign car to drive and lots of time to kill
Lord, my mind keeps on remembering the days of me and you
When we were down to nothing, nothing sure looked good on you

[Chorus]
You said you needed simple things that I had plenty of
And through the days of dark and rain, we could always live on love
With his style of life, he lured you and you could not refuse
But when we were down to nothing, nothing sure looked so good on you

[Verse 2]
When you honeymooned in Paris, it was carried on the news
And I heard you laughed your cares away on a Caribbean cruise
You were always one for dreaming, now your dreams can all come true
But when we were down to nothing, nothing sure looked good on you

[Chorus]
You said you needed simple things that I had plenty of
And through the days of dark and rain, we could always live on love
With his style of life, he lured you and you could not refuse
But when we were down to nothing, nothing sure looked good on you
Yes, when we were down to nothing, nothing sure looked good on you
