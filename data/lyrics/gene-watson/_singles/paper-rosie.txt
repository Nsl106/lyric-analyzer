[Verse 1]
The sun goes down in Calvin County
Neon lights from an old beer sign
Shown through the window out on the sidewalk
As I walked in to pass the time
I looked around, sat down at a table
Ordered beef on rye and a glass of wine
And through the door came a little old lady
She was selling paper roses and they only cost a dime

[Chorus 1]
Paper Rosie, Paper Rosie
She sold you paper roses, but they only cost a dime

[Verse 2]
Silver hair that's lost its gold
Trembling hand as she passed the rose
Red crepe paper made nature's bouquet
Help a little old lady, buy a rose today
I took the rose from her trembling hand
With eyes of age, she smiled and walked away
Like a breath of spring, I could smell the rose
It came alive and I heard her say

[Chorus 2]
"Buy my roses, pretty roses
They're only made of paper, but they only cost a dime"

[Verse 3]
I went to look for her outside
A spray of roses lay by her side
The sky lit up and a choir sang
A thousand voices as the church bells rang

[Chorus 3]
They sang, "Rosie (Rosie), Paper Rosie (Rosie)
She sold you paper roses, but they only cost a dime
Paper Rosie (Rosie), Paper Rosie (Rosie)
She sold you paper roses, but they only cost a dime
