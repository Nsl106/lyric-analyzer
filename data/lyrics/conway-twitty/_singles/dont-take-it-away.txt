I've been looking for you all night long, darling
You got to talk to me
I want to tell you how wrong I've been
And I won't do it again
You know that woman didn't mean a thing to me

I hope I don't embarrass you too much
Here in front of all your friends
I'm gonna get down on my knees
Please let me make it, please I can't give you up
'Cause you've made love so good for me, so long

Don't take it away 'cause love don't come easy
Darling, I'm sorry I stepped over the line
Don't take it away, don't make me go crazy
'Cause I would follow you to the ends of my mind

From now on I'm gonna be the kind
Of man you can lean on
And when the waters of life
Get a little too rough or a little too deep
I'm gonna be your stepping stone
And oh, I remember all those nights
That you used to take right a hold of me
And you'd hold on

Please let me make it, please I can't give you up
'Cause you've made love so good for me so long

Don't take it away, cause love don't come easy
Darling, I'm sorry I stepped over the line
Don't take it away, don't make me go crazy
'Cause I would follow you to the ends of my mind...
