[Verse 1]
You love the way it makes me feel
When I can't catch my breath
Like walkin' on a high wire
Lord, it scares me half to death
You're always high above me
And I'm always fallin' down
Our love's just a circus, baby
And I'm just the clown

[Chorus]
And I'll do tricks for you
Just like you want me to
I'll do anything it takes
Just to hang around
I'll paint a smile for you
To cover up my frown
'Cause our love's a circus
And I'm just the clown

[Verse 2]
Everyone's in love with you
But they just look at me and laugh
And I'll bet when they see me cry
They think it's just an act
Ah, but someday when it's over
And we bring the big top down
You can say it was one big circus
And I was just the clown

[Chorus]
And I'll do tricks for you
Just like you want me to
I'll do anything it takes
Just to hang around
I'll paint a smile for you
To cover up my frown
'Cause you love the circus
But you don't love the clown
