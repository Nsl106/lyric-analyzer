[Verse 1]
I walked with you and talked with you
And held your loving hand
We loved awhile and I lived awhile
And I thought that fate had it planned

[Chorus]
Then someone stole my angel
And I lost what I loved most
I may never get to Heaven
But I once came mighty close

[Bridge]
I may never play a golden harp
Or spread celestial wings
Or walk a golden staircase
Wile the distant chorus sings

[Chorus]
But once I held your sweet love
And felt your tender touch
I may never get to Heaven
But I didn't miss it much
I may never get to Heaven
But I once came mighty close
