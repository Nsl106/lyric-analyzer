You were always there for me, Julia
I was so afraid to fall in love
I thought you'd wait for me
Is it too late for me now?
Have you given up?

How it must have hurt you, Julia
Waitin' for your love to be returned
I never knew how
What can I do now that I
Have finally learned?

I never thought that love could hurt me
Now I tremble at the thought of losing you
And all the perfect words desert me now
Just in case it matters
I love you

May I have this dance with you, Julia?
Won't you let me hold you one more time?
The music is over
But I'll hold you closer this time, Julia
Julia
