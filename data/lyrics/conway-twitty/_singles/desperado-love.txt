Should I just ride in and steal you away?
Don't know what else to do
I've got a desperado love for you
You say you belong to another man
The first time we met I knew
That I have a desperado love for you

Chorus:
I know that it breaks every law
To feel the way I'm feeling
But I want your love so desperately

I don't see the wrong in stealing
So hold on I'm gonna shoot for the heart
Like desperados do
I've got a desperado love for you

--- Instrumental ---

It's so wrong to take what isn't mine
And head out for the border
But I can't look at you and have
Respect for law and order

So hold on
I'm gonna' shoot for the heart
Like desperados do
I've got a desperado love for you
I've got a desperado love for you
