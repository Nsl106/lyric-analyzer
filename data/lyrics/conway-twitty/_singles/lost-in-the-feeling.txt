We step out on the dance floor
The band starts to play
Holding you close I get carried away
Finding that falling is easy to do
Lost in the feeling with you

Time standing still as I whirl you around
We're dancing without
Even touching the ground
Finding that falling is easy to do
Lost in the feeling with you

No words are spoken
That don't need to be said
You and the music
Had gone to my head

But I'll just go on
When the music is through
Lost in the feeling with you
Lost in the feeling with you

Lost in the feeling with you...
