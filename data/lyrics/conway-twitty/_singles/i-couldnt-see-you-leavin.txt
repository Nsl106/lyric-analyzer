Lying all alone in this midnight blue
With nothing but these memories of you
Staring at these walls that are closing in
Wondering if you're ever coming back again

Now I'm just a prisoner in this big old bed
Living with the things that I should've said
Why is it always after someone's gone
That you begin to see where you went wrong

Chorus:
I couldn't see you leaving, but I can see you're gone
That note you left on my pillow said I was on my own
I never heard you crying, 'cause I was seldom home
I couldn't see you leaving, but I can see you're gone

--- Instrumental ---

I just keep wondering where you are tonight
And if someone else is holding you tight
It took you walking out the door to see
That I'm really nothing when you're not with me

I did a good job of fooling myself
Thinking that you're love would stay on the shelf
But how could anybody be so blind
To have to wake up alone and find

Chorus:
I couldn't see you leaving, but I can see you're gone
That note you left on my pillow said I was on my own
I never heard you crying, 'cause I was seldom home
I couldn't see you leaving, but I can see you're gone

I couldn't see you leaving, but I can see you're gone...
