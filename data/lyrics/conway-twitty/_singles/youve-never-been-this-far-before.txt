[Verse 1]
I can almost hear the stillness
As it yields to the sound of your heart beating
(Bum bum bum)
And I can almost hear the echo
Of the thoughts that I know you must be thinking
(Bum bum bum)
And I can feel your body tremble
As you wonder what this moment holds in store
(Bum bum bum)
And as I put my arms around you
I can tell you've never been this far before
(Bum bum bum)

[Verse 2]
I don't know what I'm saying
As my trembling fingers touch forbidden places
(Bum bum bum)
I only know I've waited
For so long for the chance that we are taking
(Bum bum bum)
I don't know and I don't care
What made you tell him you don't love him anymore
(Bum bum bum)
And as I taste your tender kisses
I can tell you've never been this far before
(Bum bum bum)

[Bridge]
And as I take the love you're giving
I can feel the tension building in your mind
(Bum bum bum, uh huh huh, bum bum bum)
And you're wondering if tomorrow
I'll still love you like I'm loving you tonight
(Bum bum bum, uh huh huh, bum bum bum)

[Verse 3]
You have no way of knowing
But tonight will only make me love you more
(Mmm mmm mmm)
And I hope that you'll believe me
'Cause I know you've never been this far before
(Bum bum bum, bum bum bum, bum bum bum)
