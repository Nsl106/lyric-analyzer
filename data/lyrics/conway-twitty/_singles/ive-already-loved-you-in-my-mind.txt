I thought I've never seen a girl like her in here before
And I could see her watching me as I walk across the floor
I asked her if she'd like to dance
When the band starts up again
She said I never danced with strangers
I don't even know your name

I said we're not exactly strangers, you and I
My thoughts were running wild and free
As I watched you tonight
Just think about it and you'll find
We're not exactly strangers
I've already loved you in my mind

The band started playing a slow moving song
She got up and easily moved into my arms
I kept on saying the things a girl likes to hear
And when the dance was over she whispered in my ear

She said we're not exactly strangers, you and I
My thoughts were running wild and free
While you held me tight
I thought about it and I find
We're not exactly strangers
I've already loved you in my mind...
