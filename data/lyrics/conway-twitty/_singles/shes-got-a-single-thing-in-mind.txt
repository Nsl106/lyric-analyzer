She can't find the words to break it to me
Cause she always was the gentle kind
She's hopin' I'll hear it from a friend somewhere
She's hopin' I'll read between the lines
But it comes as no surprise
Cause she told me with her eyes

So watch her untie the tie that binds
She's got a single thing in mind

She's already gone, except in body
It's just a matter now, of time
Well I should have seen the storm clouds gathering
But he who won't look is just as blind
So there's only me to blame
When my woman dropped my name

So watch her untie the tie that binds
She's got a single thing in mind

So watch her untie the tie that binds
She's got a single thing in mind
