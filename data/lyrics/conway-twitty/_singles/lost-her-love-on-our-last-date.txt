[Verse 1]
It's over, our love affair
Too late now I find I care
Her sweet love, never more I'll share
Now she's gone, I'm alone
I was wrong, should have known
Took her home after our last date

[Verse 2]
I searched for a simple way
To tell her what I had to say
And I kissed her then I turned away
Set her free, foolishly, destiny misery
Tragedy, on our last date

[Bridge]
Took my ring from her trembling finger
Brushed the tears from my baby's eyes
Walked away, didn't know
That I'd soon miss her so
I guess I was too young to realize

[Verse 3]
So blind I couldn't see
How much she really meant to me
And that soon she would always be
On my mind, in my heart
I was blind from the start
Lost her love on our last date
