[Verse 1]
Maybe you don't know me any more than I know you
And I wouldn't blame you if you walked away
I've been watching you all evening with those teardrops in your eyes
And it touches me much more than I can say
You know I hate to think that someone could have hurt someone like you
And if I was him I'd be right by your side

[Chorus]
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me a while
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me a while

[Verse 2]
Saw you in the corner from the moment I walked in
Saw your lonely face across the room
No I won't forget you and the way it could have been
Why'd you have to leave so soon
You know I hate to think there's someone you loved instead of me
'Cause at times like this I'd be right by your side

[Chorus]
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me a while
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me a while

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me a while
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me a while
