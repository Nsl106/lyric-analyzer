[Verse 1]
I pinch myself when I wake up each morning
'Cause I'm constantly amazed when I see
Exactly everything I've always wanted
But I can't believe she gives it all to me

[Verse 2]
Lips that warm my face with morning kisses
Arms that reach to hold me tenderly
And love that always satisfies completely
But I can't believe she gives it all to me

[Verse 3]
She gives me more than any one man deserves
I who have everything am nothing without her
Somehow she knows I need her desperately
I can't believe she gives it all to me
