[Verse 1]
Hello Darlin', nice to see you, it's been a long time
You're just as lovely as you used to be
How's your new love, are you happy? Hope you're doin' fine
Just to know it means so much to me

[Verse 2]
What's that, Darlin', how am I doin'? I'm doin' alright
Except I can't sleep, I cry all night 'til dawn
What I'm trying to say is I love you and I miss you
And I'm so sorry that I did you wrong

[Verse 3]
Look up, Darlin', let me kiss you just for old times' sake
Let me hold you in my arms one more time
Thank you, Darlin', may God bless you and each step you take
Bring you closer to the things you seek to find

[Verse 4]
Goodbye Darlin', gotta go now, gotta try to find a way
To lose these memories of a love so warm and true
And if you should ever find it in your heart to forgive me
Come back, Darlin', I'll be waitin' for you
