Does she seem a little cold when you love her
Does she turn away when you hold her tight
Just search your soul and you will discover
How you hurt her, night after night

Chorus:
And when was the first time she begged you to love her
But you turned away and acted like a fool
And when was the first time she lay there and cried
Well, that's when she started to stop loving you

Do you wonder why she's turning to another
And if you love her you'd better tell her so
'Cause she's finding out that anyone will love her
And it won't be long 'till yoy'll have to let her go

Chorus:
And when was the first time she begged you to love her
But you turned away and acted like a fool
And when was the first time she lay there and cried
Well, that's when she started to stop loving you...
