Today I heard my woman say something I never heard her say before
She just told me that she was going to leave me and that she didn't love me anymore
But I know that the loving kindness and the understanding is still there somewhere
So I'm gonna get down on my knees and I'm gonna say to my baby

Touch the hand of the man that made you a woman
Then tell me you don't love me anymore

I was the first man to ever
Hold you in a special kind of way
And those unfamiliar feelings that caused you to tremble
I know you remember today
Before you decide that your gonna leave me
And do things you've never done before

Touch the hand of the man that made you a woman
Then tell me you don't love me anymore

The two lips that once held sweet surprises
Surprised me and said goodbye today
And those two lovin' arms that use to reach for me
Just reached out and pushed me away
I know you believe you don't love me
Before you walk out that door

Touch the hand of the man that made you a woman
Then tell me you don't love me anymore
