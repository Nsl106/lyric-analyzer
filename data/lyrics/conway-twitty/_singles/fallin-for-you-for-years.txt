Lookin' at us they'd think that we just met
And only been in love a night or two
They see a beautiful woman
In the shadows with a man
And all they see is a weekend rendezvous

Guess we look like cheaters?
Lover's lyin' low?
We must be decievers
'Cause baby they don't know

I've been fallin' for you for years
Can't get over the feel of you
Something in the way you make your moves
I've been fallin' for you for years
Runnin' deep, runnin' strong
It's been goin' on and on, for years

--- Instrumental ---

You make it easy to be a one woman man
Just look at you sitting there
Your eyes are talkin' in that soft and sexy way
Sayin' let's slip away, slip away somewhere
It don't take a rainy night or music in the dark
But baby when your body sends a message to my heart

I've been fallin' for you for years
Can't get over the feel of you
Something in the way you make your moves
I've been fallin' for you for years
Runnin' deep, runnin' strong
It's been goin' on and on and on and on

I've been fallin' for you for years
Can't get over the feel of you
Something in the way you make your moves
I've been fallin' for you for years
Runnin' deep, runnin' strong
It's been goin' on and on and on and on and on
(Fallin' for you for years ...)
