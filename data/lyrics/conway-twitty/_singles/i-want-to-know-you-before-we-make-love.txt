Sometimes all you need is someone to hold you
Sometimes that's all you're looking for
I'd like to take the time to get to know you
I don't want this time to be like all the times before

I want to hold you before I make love to you
I want to show you all of my heart
And when I look into your eyes
I want to feel the love inside, you
I want to know you before we make love

--- Instrumental ---

I've learned from all those lonely nights with strangers
It takes time for real love to be found
I feel the invitation of your body
I'd like to look inside your soul before I lay you down

I want to hold you before I make love to you
I want to show you all of my heart
And when I look into your eyes
I want to feel the love inside, you
I want to know you before we make love

I want to hold you before I make love to you
I want to show you all of my heart
And when I look into those eyes
I want to feel the love inside, you
I want to know you before we make
Before we make, love...
