You came to me, and you threw me, with a simple goodbye
I begged your forgiveness but you won't even try
You just say that its all over, that you'll soon forget
But I still remember, I'm not through loving you yet

No, I'm not through loving you
I just need some time
To make the plans that we made come true
Now, you are tired of trying and soon I'll regret
That I couldn't hold you
I'm not through loving you yet

--- Instrumental ---

No, I'm not through loving you
I just need some time
To make the plans that we made come true
But your tired of trying and soon I'll regret
That I couldn't hold you
I'm not through loving you yet..
