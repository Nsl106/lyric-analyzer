[Verse 1]
Don't you think you should have called to tell me you were coming down?
Oh, you look so out of place on this troubled side of town
It's a place where losers go when they know there's nothing left
And after losing you, I just lost the will to live

[Chorus]
Do you believe me now?
I told you time and time again
My heart and soul is your hands
Do you believe me now?
Do you believe me now?
Look at the living, dying proof
I ain't nothing without you
Do you believe me now?

[Verse 2]
I don't know what changed your mind, I won't ask if this is real
I don't know if you're a dream, I only know how good it feels
If you could find it in your heart to say the fire for me still burns
I'll find a place to turn around down this road of no return

[Chorus]
Do you believe me now?
I told you time and time again
My heart and soul is your hands
Do you believe me now?
Do you believe me now?
Look at the living, dying proof
I ain't nothing without you
Do you believe me now?
