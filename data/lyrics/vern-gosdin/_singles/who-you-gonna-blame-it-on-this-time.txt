Oh, you say that it wasn't your fault, the reason that you're late
You had some good excuses and your alibis are great
You'd think by now you would have used up all your lies
Who are you gonna blame it on this time?
Get out in the open so I can plainly see
You have never failed at making me believe
Oh, I can't wait to hear, I like to see you shine
So who are you gonna blame it on this time?
Oh, I want to believe you and I do every time
It's what keeps us together and that's fine
So I can't wait to hear, I like to see you shine
Who are you gonna blame it on this time?
Oh, I want to believe you and I do every time
It's what keeps us together and that's fine
So I can't wait to hear, I like to see you shine
So who are you gonna blame it on this time?
