Well I woke up one morning with a note up on my chest
It said Im gone for good you're no longer with the best
I never dreamed thered ever be another made for you
So I just went crazy there was nothing left to do
I used to be crazy over you
Nobody else could move me like you used to
I had to be out of my mind thinking I'd soon be over you
But Im still crazy and Im not over you
When the bad news finally hit me lord it hurt me to the bone
I was just a fool to think you could be just a little bit gone
But it would be easy it wouldn't be hard to forget
Little did I know that I hadnt seen nothing yet
I used to be crazy over you
Nobody else could move me like you used to
I had to be out of my mind thinking I'd soon be over you
But Im still crazy and Im not over you
Oh Im still crazy and Im not over you
Oh Im still crazy and Im not over you
Oh Im still crazy and Im not over you
