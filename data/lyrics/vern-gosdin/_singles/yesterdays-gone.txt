I put away the groceries
And I take my daily bread
I dream of your arms around me
As I tuck the kids in bed

I don't know what you're doin'
And I don't know where you are
But I look up at that great big sky
And I hope you're wishin' on that same bright star

I wonder
I pray
And I sleep alone
And I cry alone

And it's so hard livin' here on my own
So please come home soon, come home soon

I know that we're together
Even though we're far apart
And I wear our lucky penny
Around my neck pressed to my heart

(And) I wonder
I pray
I sleep alone
I cry alone

And it's so hard livin' here on my own
So please (come home soon.)

I still imagine your touch
It's beautiful missing something that much
But sometimes love needs a fighting chance
So I'll wait my turn until it's our turn to dance

I wonder
I pray
I sleep alone
I cry alone

Without you this house is not a home
So please (come home soon)

I walk alone
I try alone
And I'll wait for I don't want to die alone
So please come home soon

Come home soon

Come home soon
