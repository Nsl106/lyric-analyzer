[Verse 1]
I woke up with a headache today
'Cause I've got mortgage due
And an empty bed to make
And girl, it's funny to me
How much I hate your memory
But unlike you, it'll always be me
No matter how bad I wanted to leave

[Verse 2]
Started smoking cigarettes again
But I only light a few, 'cause you're not here to tell me I can't
And girl, I wish I could say whiskey helps to drown the pain
But it only helps to drive me insane
Every time I hear your name

[Chorus]
Baby, I bet you're happy now
Probably found you someone new
Who's got his life all figured out
As for me, I stay locked up in this old bedroom
Writing songs for you and thinking about us
Girl, I thought it was love

[Verse 3]
Went to bed with a headache tonight
'Cause I've got a mortgage due
And no one laying by my side
I never knew a king size bed would get so cold
When the king is down and he is all alone
Lord knows, I need a queen to hold

[Chorus]
And baby, I bet you're happy now
Probably found you someone new
Who's got his life all figured out
As for me, I stay locked up in this old bedroom
Writing songs for you and thinking about us
Girl, I thought it was love

[Post-Chorus]
Girl, I knew it was love
I guess I didn't know what love was
