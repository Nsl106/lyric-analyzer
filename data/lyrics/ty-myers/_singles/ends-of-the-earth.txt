[Verse 1]
From the silence of the speakers
To the bow in your hair
To the sweet smell of perfume
That's hovering in the air
To the faintest of moonlight
Peeking through the blinds
To the feeling of new love
That's yet to be tried
But I'm getting pretty tired
These little games you play
Where we get so damn close
But you, you up and walk away

[Chorus]
To the ends of the earth, I will
I'll follow you where the
Horizon meets the sunrise if that's
Just what you choose to do
If you choose to love me or if you
Choose to leave again, yeah
'Til the end of the earth
I'll be your man

[Verse 2]
Oh, you're the one and only
The true cream of the crop
You're the whole sundae
And the cherry on top
But you invite me in
Just to close the door
You got my heart chewed up, spit out
And broken on the floor

[Chorus]
To the ends of the earth, I will
I'll follow you where the
Horizon meets the sunrise if that's
Just what you choose to do
If you choose to love me or if you
Choose to leave again, yeah
'Til the end of the earth
I'll be your man

[Outro]
If you choose to love me or if you
Choose to leave again, yeah
'Til the end of the earth
I'll be your man
