[Intro: Macy Maloy]
Oh, oh, woah, yeah
Woah, woah, woah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Chase Rice, Chase Rice & Macy Maloy]
Take off those heels, lay on my bed
Whisper dirty secrets while I'm pullin' on your hair
Poison in our veins, but we don't even care
Candles drippin' on your body, baby, this ain't truth or dare
Everybody wonders where we run off to
My body on your body, baby, stickin' like some glue
Naughty, let's get naughty, girl, it's only one or two
The fever's fuckin' runnin', feel the heat between us two

[Chorus: Chase Rice]
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm-I'm gon' ride
On you, baby, on you, lady, all night, all-all night
I'ma take care of your body, I'll be gentle, don't you scream
It's gettin' hotter, make it softer, feel your chest on top of me
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm-I'm gon' ride
On you, baby, on you, lady, all night, all-all night
I'm gon' make you feel that lovin', gettin' weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip-top all the way down to your feet

[Post-Chorus: Chase Rice & Macy Maloy]
Yeah, girl, we can go slow (Oh, woah, yeah)
Yeah, we can go slow (Woah, woah, woah, yeah)
(Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Chase Rice & Macy Maloy, Chase Rice]
Lay on your back, like you right there
Don't have to say it twice, love, there's nothin' here to fear
Takin' it back, back to where it's clear
Rollin' on and on, sounds of love are in the air

[Chorus: Chase Rice]
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm-I'm gon' ride
On you, baby, on you, lady, all night, all-all night
I'ma take care of your body, I'll be gentle, don't you scream
It's gettin' hotter, make it softer, feel your chest on top of me
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm-I'm gon' ride
On you, baby, on you, lady, all night, all-all night
I'm gon' make you feel that lovin', gettin' weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip-top all the way down to your feet

[Post-Chorus: Macy Maloy]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Ooh, ooh)
Oh, oh

[Bridge: Chase Rice & Macy Maloy]
The sun's comin' up (Oh)
You're on my side (Oh)
I rub your thigh (Oh)
You look in my eyes (Eyes)
And I just see the sky (Oh, see the sky)
I'm so high (Oh, I'm so high)
And I ain't smoked yet (Oh, oh)
I'm just comin' down from this (Oh)

[Chorus: Chase Rice, Macy Maloy & Both]
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm-I'm gon' ride
On you, baby, on you, lady, all night, all-all night
I'ma take care of your body, I'll be gentle, don't you scream (Take care of your body)
It's gettin' hotter, make it softer, feel your chest on top of me
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm-I'm gon' ride
On you, baby, on you, lady, all night, all-all night (All night)
I'm gon' make you feel that lovin', gettin' weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip-top all the way down to your feet

[Post-Chorus: Macy Maloy]
Ooh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
