[Chorus]
I'm blue to the bone since my loving baby's up and gone
All that I can do is sit and moan and be blue, blue to the bone

[Verse 1]
He said he'd always love me and stay right by my side
But that ain't what he's doing, he's with someone new tonight
While I'm blue to the bone

[Chorus]
I'm blue to the bone since my loving baby's up and gone
All that I can do is sit and moan and be blue, blue to the bone

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I oughtta let his leaving roll right off of me
But all that I feel rolling are teardrops down my cheeks
While I'm blue to the bone

[Outro]
All that my true love has been this song
All that I can do is sit and moan and be blue, blue to the bone
All that I can do is sit and moan and be blue, blue to the bone
I'm so blue, blue to the bone
