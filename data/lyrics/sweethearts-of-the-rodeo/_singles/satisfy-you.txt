[Chorus]
Oh baby, tell me true, what in the world's come over you
Oh darling, I would do anything to satisfy you
Anything to satisfy you

[Verse 1]
Said I'd stay with you forever, meant those words with all my heart
Now whenever we're together, I feel like we're miles apart
Like a stranger in the dark

[Chorus]
Oh baby, tell me true, what in the world's come over you
Oh darling, I would do anything to satisfy you
Anything to satisfy you

[Verse 2]
Honey, you don't have to hurry, just relax and take your time
I don't know what you don't tell me, I don't mean to be unkind
Honey, I can't read your mind

[Chorus]
Oh baby, tell me true, what in the world's come over you
Oh darling, I would do anything to satisfy you
Anything to satisfy you

[Verse 3]
I just wanna see you happy, I just hate to see you cry
Tell me what it takes to please you, there is nothing I won't try
Anything but say goodbye

[Chorus]
Oh baby, tell me true, what in the world's come over you
Oh darling, I would do anything to satisfy you
Anything to satisfy you

[Fiddle Solo]

[Outro]
Oh baby, tell me true, what in the world's come over you
Oh darling, I would do anything to satisfy you
Oh baby, tell me true, what in the world's come over you
Oh darling, I would do anything to satisfy you
Oh baby, tell me true, what in the world's come over you
Oh darling, I would do anything to satisfy you
Oh baby, tell me true, what in the world's come over you
