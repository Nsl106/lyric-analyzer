[Verse 1]
Baby's good to me, you know he's happy as can be
You know he said so, I'm in love with him and I feel fine
Baby says he's mine, you know he tells me all the time
You know he said so, I'm in love with him and I feel fine

[Refrain]
I'm so glad I'm his little girl, he's so glad he's telling all the world

[Chorus]
That my baby buys me things, you know he buys me diamond rings
You know he said so, I'm in love with him and I feel fine

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Baby says he's mine, you know he tells me all the time
You know he said so, I'm in love with him and I feel fine

[Refrain]
I'm so glad I'm his little girl, he's so glad he's telling all the world

[Chorus]
And my baby buys me things, you know he buys me diamond rings
You know he said so, I'm in love with him and I feel fine
I'm in love with him and I feel fine
