[Verse 1]
Sometimes it feels like, I'm gonna break
Sometimes this world, gives more than I can take
Sometimes, sunshine gets lost in the rain
And it keeps pourin' down
It just keeps comin' down

[Chorus]
This life would kill me if I didn't have you
I couldn't live without you, baby
I wouldn't want to
If you didn't love me so much
I'd never make it through
'Cause this life would kill me
This life would kill me if I didn't have you

[Verse 2]
You are my heart, every breath I breathe
And I'm safe in your arms, you rescue me
When I'm weak, you're strong
If you were gone I don't know where I'd be
You were made for me
You were made for me

[Chorus]
This life would kill me if I didn't have you
I couldn't live without you, baby
I wouldn't want to
If you didn't love me so much
I'd never make it through
'Cause this life would kill me
This life would kill me if I didn't have you

[Bridge]
If you didn't love me so much
If you didn't love me so much
This life would kill me if I didn't have you
This life would kill me
I couldn't live without you, baby
I wouldn't want to

[Chorus]
If you didn't love me so much
I'd never make it through
'Cause this life would kill me
This life would kill me if I didn't have you
