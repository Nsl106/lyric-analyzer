[Verse 1]
Tonight I am thankful
'Cause tomorrow begins
A lifetime together
And two hearts will win

[Verse 2]
I have loved you as surely
As love has no shame
For as long as you're listening
I'll whisper your name

[Chorus]
I will whisper your name
When you're wounded and caught
Or when love beats so loudly
A whisper is lost
And if I made the rules
And if time was the game
I would promise forever
To whisper your name

[Verse 3]
Well if you strike a match
And set the whole world aflame
And they used up the oceans
And still prayed for rain

[Chorus]
When they cry for the guilty
I'll take the blame
And when no one is listening
I'll whisper your name

[Chorus]
I will whisper your name
When you're wounded and caught
Or when love beats so loudly
A whisper is lost
And if I made the rules
And if time was the game
I would promise forever
To whisper your name

[Bridge]
And if I made the rules
And if time was the game
I would promise forever
To whisper your name

[Chorus]
I will whisper your name
When you're wounded and caught
Or when love beats so loudly
A whisper is lost
And if I made the rules
And if time was the game
I would promise forever
To whisper your name
I will promise forever
To whisper your name
