[Verse 1]
He asked her, "What gifts can I bring you
To prove that my love for you is true?
I want to make you mine forever
There's nothing on this earth I would not do"

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She said, "Anything I've wanted
You have given willingly
So, now there's only one more thing I need"

[Chorus]
If you love me, give me wings
And don't be afraid if I fly
A bird in a cage will forget how to sing
If you love me, give me wings

[Verse 2]
He walked over to the window
He silently stared into space
Then he said, "Well, I just want to protect you
'Cause this world is a dangerous place"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
She put her arms around him
She said, "I know you mean well
But there are lessons I must learn for myself"

[Chorus]
If you love me, give me wings
And don't be afraid if I fly
A bird in a cage will forget how to sing
You can trust me, so give me wings

[Bridge]
She said, "Up above the clouds
You can see forever
And I know you and I can learn to fly together"

[Chorus]
If you love me, give me wings
Don't be afraid if I fly
A bird in a cage will forget how to sing
You can trust me, so give me wings

[Outro]
If you really love me
Give me wings
Give me wings
