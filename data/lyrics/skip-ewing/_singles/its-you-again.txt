[Verse 1]
In the middle of my day
If somethin' takes my thoughts away
It's almost always safe to say
That it's you again

[Verse 2]
You always leave me wanting more
So my heart keeps listenin' for
That certain little knock upon my door
When it's you again

[Chorus]
Oh, you're with me all the time
In my heart and on my mind
In everything I do, when love comes shinin' through
Oh, I know it's you again

[Verse 3]
I'm happy with the kind of life I lead
I'm pretty good at takin' care of me
There's really only one thing that I need
You again

[Chorus]
Oh, you're with me all the time
In my heart and on my mind
In everything I do, when love comes shinin' through
Oh, I know it's you again

[Verse 4]
And in the middle of the night
Even when I turn out all the lights
There's always one still burnin' bright
And it's you again

[Chorus]
Oh, you're with me all the time
In my heart and on my mind
In everything I do, when love comes shinin' through
Oh, I know it's you again

[Outro]
It's you again
Woah, it's you again
