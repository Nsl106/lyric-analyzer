[Verse 1]
I remember when Mary Lou said, "You want to walk me home from school?"
Well, I said, "Yes, I do"
She said, "I don't have to go right home, and I'm the kind that likes to be alone some if you would"
I said, "Me, too"
And so we took a stroll
Wound up down by the swimming hole
And she said, "Do what you want to do"
I got silly and found a frog in the water by a hollow log
And I shook it at her and I said, "This frog's for you"
And she said

[Chorus]
"I don't like spiders and snakes
And that ain't what it takes to love me
You fool, you fool
I don't like spiders and snakes
And that ain't what it takes to love me
Like I want to be loved by you"

[Verse 2]
Well, I think of that girl from time to time
I call her up when I got a dime
I say, "Hello, baby"
She says, "Ain't you cool"
I say, "Do you remember when?
And would you like to get together again?"
She says, "I'll see you after school"
I was shy and so for a while most of my love was touch and smile
'Til she said, "Come on over here"
I was nervous, as you might guess, still looking for something to slip down her dress
And she said, "Let's make it perfectly clear"
She said

[Chorus]
"I don't like spiders and snakes
And that ain't what it takes to love me
You fool, you fool
I don't like spiders and snakes
And that ain't what it takes to love me
Like I want to be loved by you"
