[Verse 1]
I was lousy at math, a failed historian
Carlene was the valedictorian
I was quarterback in the back of the class
As she was the whiz kid in the horned rim glasses
It's been a long time since I've been around
Since I set foot on my old stomping ground
I ended up by the old school yard
When this red head pulls up in a blue sports car
And says, "I bet you don't remember, I guess it's been forever"
It took a second to put it all together, I said

[Chorus]
Ooh la-la-la-la-la
Looking good Carlene
Woah my-my-my-my-my
Time's been good to you
If you know what I mean
Girl, you glitter like Hollywood
Good gosh, Carlene
You sure are looking good

[Verse 2]
She said, "Hop in, let's go for a spin
Tell me what you been doing, boy, and where you've been"
I said, "I write songs, you probably didn't know
And I finally got a couple out on country radio
She said, "What a switch, ain't life funny, I've got a PHD
Now I'm modeling for money"
Imagine little Miss 4.0 just smiling for the camera on the cover of Vogue
I said, "You've come a long way since graduation
Let me say without reservation
You've surpassed everyone's expectations"

[Chorus]
Ooh la-la-la-la-la
Looking good Carlene
Woah my-my-my-my-my
Time's been good to you
If you know what I mean
Girl, you glitter like Hollywood
Good gosh, Carlene
You sure are looking good

[Bridge]
I said, "I hope to see you again someday"
She said, "Another ten years is too long to wait
Pick me up at my mama's at eight"
And I said

[Chorus]
Ooh la-la-la-la-la
Looking good Carlene
Woah my-my-my-my-my
Time's been good to you
If you know what I mean
Ooh la-la-la-la-la
Looking good Carlene
Woah my-my-my-my-my
Time's been good to you
If you know what I mean
Ooh la-la-la-la-la
Looking good Carlene
Woah my-my-my-my-my
Time's been good to you
If you know what I mean
