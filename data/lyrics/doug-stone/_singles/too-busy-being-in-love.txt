If I had taken the time
To write down a few lines
Everytime that you crossed this heart of mine
I'd put them all in a book
How much time would that have took
The words and years have a way of slipping back

Oh no! Too bad, there goes the chance that I had
I could have written a play so sweet and so funny
Given old Mr. Shakespere a run for his money
Written the words to the prettiest tune
That would never leave a dry eye in the room
My only excuse for not doing enough
I was too busy being in love
Yes I was too busy being in love

Brand new phrases appear everytime you are near
All this words you inspire after all these years
But I never reached for a pen
Break the mood that im in
Before I knew that the words were gone again

Oh no! Too bad, there goes the chance that I had
I could have written a play so sweet and so funny
Given old Mr. Shakespere a run for his money
Written the words to the prettiest tune
That would never leave a dry eye in the room
My only excuse for not doing enough
I was too busy being in love
Yes I was too busy being in love

I could have written the poem to make young lovers crazy
I could have written the movie for Hepburn and Tracey
Most beautiful song and it starts with your name
Written my way into fortune and fame
But I have no regrets for not doing enough
I was too busy being in love
Yes I was too busy being in love
