[Verse 1]
Once I promised, I'd do anything to please you
And looking back you must admit I've tried
Now you stand there and tell me I must leave you
But I can't go, I guess I must have lied

[Chorus]
For these lips don't know how to say goodbye
And my heart doesn't even wanna try
Now these feet can do the walkin', oh, but you must do the talkin'
For these lips don't know how to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
If you'd ask me for the stars that shine above you
Then I could come much closer to the mark
So don't stand there and tell me not to love you
Unless you stop the beating of my heart

[Chorus]
For these lips don't know how to say goodbye
And my heart doesn't even wanna try
Now these feet can do the walkin', honey, you must do the talkin'
For these lips don't know how to say goodbye

[Outro]
No these lips don't know how to say goodbye
