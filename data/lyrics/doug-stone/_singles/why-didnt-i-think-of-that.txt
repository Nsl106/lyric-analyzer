He sends her roses and lines he composes
Things a lady loves
Well he's there to hold her
When she needs a shoulder
If life gets too rough
Oh now that she's left
I keep kicking myself whenever
I start thinking back
He says he needs her
Tells her he loves her
Why didn't I think of that?

When she gets down
Well he's always around her
He makes her smile again
He mends her heartaches
Remembers her birthday
And tries to be a friend
Now that she's gone
I know what I did wrong
It's all so simple in fact
Well he says he wants her
Can't live without her
Why didn't I think of that?

(Chorus)
Ooh I've been watching
Every move that he makes
Ooh I've been thinking
It could have been different somehow
If I'd know what I know now

He sings her love songs
And tells her his love's strong
Things she needs to know
He tries to please her
And calls for no reason
Just to say hello
He says he loves her
And he'll never leave her
And I never will get her back
I did my best
Thought of everything eles
Why didn't I think of that?

(chorus)
Ooh i've been watching
Every move that he makes
Ooh I've been thinking
It could have been different somehow
If i'd know what I know now

He sends her roses
And lines he compses
Things a lady loves
Well he's there to hold her
When she needs a shoulder
If life gets too rough
Oh now that she's left
I keep kicking myself whenever
I start thinking back
He says he needs her
Tells her he loves her
Why didn't I think of that?

He says he loves her
And he'll never leave her
Why didn't I think of that?
