Bobby was a beautiful girl
From a small town in a great big world
Her daddy owned the corner store
Off of 7th Ave

Danny-Jo just turned 19
Cigarettes rolled under his sleeve
His leather jacket and his faded jeans
And a bad attitude

But it's hard to be tough
When you're falling in love

(chorus)
And he said:
I know I'm down on my knees
But I wanna be the one your only one
I'm beggin' you please
And I know that I don't have that much
But for whatever I don't have
I'll make up in love

Her daddy was a simple man
He raised Bobby with a real stern hand
Said he never would understand
Just what she saw in him

After workin' at the store all day
Bringin' in an honest day's pay
Man you shoulda seen his face
When Danny-Jo walked in

Sayin' please understand
With a ring in his hand

(chorus)
And he said:
I know I'm down on my knees
But I wanna be the one her only one
I'm beggin' you please
And I know that I don't have that much
But for whatever I don't have
I'll make up in love

(Bridge)
Now he lookes back and smiles
At how they walked down the isle
20 years have gone by
He remembers it still
How she bid his will
With a look in her eyes
Now he knows she was right

(chorus)
When she said:
Daddy, I'm down on my knees
But I wanna be the one his only one
I'm beggin' you please
And I know that he don't have that much
But for whatever we don't have
We'll make up in love

And for whatever they don't have
They make up in love
