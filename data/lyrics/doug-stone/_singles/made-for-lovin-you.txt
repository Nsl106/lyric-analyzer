Everybody, sings a differnt kind of song
All God's children have somewhere they belong
Oh I've heard it said, I know it must be true
We were meant to be, I'm made for loving you

Everybody, has something he must be
Call it fortune or just call it destiny
I have spent my life making my way to you
See the way we fit, I'm made for loving you

Like blue skies always sing your name with sunshine
And just like lauughter goes along with good times
I have spent my life making my way to you
See the way we fit, I'm made for loving you

Girl, I've spent my life making my way to you
See the way we fit, I'm made for loving you
