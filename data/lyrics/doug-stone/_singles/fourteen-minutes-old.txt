[Verse 1]
Well, I've had all the time I need to wonder
Just how much I miss her bein' gone
And I'm already wishing she was close enough to hold
And her memory's only fourteen minutes old

[Chorus]
Some big old tears just fell from my blue eyes
And I guess they must have been there all along
There's still some coffee in her cup and its not even cold
And her memory's only fourteen minutes old

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Well, every passing minute makes me want her
Right back in my arms where she belongs
And I'm already missing times when she was mine to hold
And her memory's only fifteen minutes old

[Chorus]
Some big old tears just fell from my blue eyes
And I guess they must have been there all along
There's still some coffee in her cup and its not even cold
And her memory's only fifteen minutes old

[Outro]
Her memory's only sixteen minutes old
And the coffee in her cup's not even cold
