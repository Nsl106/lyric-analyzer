I'd be lyin' if I said-
I never prayed for this
I can show you here and now
How much love you've missed

I'm happy that you're sad- I know
That sounds so wrong
But darlin you must know
The pains gone on too long

Come in out of the pain

Let me dry your tears
He's been gone for days
And I've loved you for years

Lay down in my arms
There ain't no shame
Don't just stand there girl-

Come in out of the pain

Well I know how, a heartache feels
Shattered when it breaks
And if you believe in me
He'll be your last mistake
I can't stop the wind and I can't stop the rain

But I can promise you that I can
Stop your pain

Come in out of the pain
And let me dry your tears
He's been gone for days
And I've loved you for years

Oh lay down in my arms
There ain't no shame-
Don't just stand there girl-

Come in out of the pain
(come in out of the pain)

Let me dry your tears
(come in out of the pain)

Girl I've loved you for years and years and years
