[Verse 1]
Every mornin' I watch you walk into the office
In your business suit and matching shoes
With your hair put up neatly, you tug at your glasses
And you sit down, just three desks down

[Pre-Chorus]
And I watch you in the florescent glare
And my mind drifts away somewhere

[Chorus]
And I see you in a different light
With your hair fallin' down, with love in your eyes
In my mind, you're a beautiful sight
I see you in a different light
Just the way I saw you last night

[Verse 2]
Well, there's girls at the office the guys always notice
When they walk by, but you're not the type
They don't know what I know, how some things just don't show
Through tailored tweads and that's fine with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Let them all think what they want to
As for me when I look at you
I see

[Chorus]
I see you in a different light
With your hair fallin' down, with love in your eyes
In my mind, you're a beautiful sight
I see you in a different light
Just the way I saw you last night

[Chorus]
Baby, it's you in a different light
With your hair fallin' down, with love in your eyes
In my mind, you're a beautiful sight
I see you in a different light
Just the way I saw you last night
It's you in a different light
With your hair fallin' down, with love in your eyes
In my mind, you're a beautiful sight
I see you in a different light
Just the way I saw you last night
