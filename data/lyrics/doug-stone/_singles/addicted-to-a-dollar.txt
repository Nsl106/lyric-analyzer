Eighty hours a week, that's what I call work
And this black under my blue collar is his best pay dirt
They work me hard from dawn to dusk
Doin' double time puttin' out sweat for a filthy buck

F.I.C.A. and the state
They make my paycheck look like a big mistake
Tax man takes his before I see a cent
And what they don't get, I've already spent

Chorus
I'm addicted to a dollar , that ain't worth a dime
I pick up my paycheck and pass it on down the line
The more money that I'm making, the less I can call mine
Well, I'm addicted to a dollar , that ain't worth a dime

Got me more payments than I've got checks
Ten more to go on this car, it's a wreck
Landlord's at my door, it's a life of hard knocks
When all I really want is my piece of the rock

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Chorus
