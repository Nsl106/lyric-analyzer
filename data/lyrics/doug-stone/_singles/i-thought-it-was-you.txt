I called your name out loud
To a stranger yesterday
When she turned around
I said "I'm sorry" and just walked away
From a distance she had that look
And for a second or two

I thought it was you
It took a moment to catch my breath
Tried to brace myself
Still don't have a clue
How to leave your mem'ry behind
After all this time
I hear there's one special love in each life
Well, I must look like a fool
I thought it was you

I still drive by your house
Takin' trips down memory lane
We had our future worked out
At least we did on that old porch swing
Today in my rearview mirror
I saw an old Malibu

I thought it was you
It took a moment to catch my breath
Tried to brace myself
Still don't have a clue
How to leave your mem'ry behind
After all this time
I hear there's one special love in each life
Well, I must look like a fool
I thought it was you

Am I really a fool?
I thought it was you

I thought it was you
Why couldn't it be you?
