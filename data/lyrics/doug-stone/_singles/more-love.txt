When we met, I told her I'd give her the moon
And I did on a silver spoon
If I'd only known the promise I kept would be wrong
Well she might not be gone
Now it's easy to see
The only thing she needed from me

Chorus
Was more love, more time
More of her knowing that she's on my mind
More of my heart would have suited her fine
Cause that's what she was dreaming of
She only needed more love

She tried telling me time and again
But I didn't listen back then
Oh my God, it took her saying goodbye
To finally open up my eyes
And if my prayers came true
I know just what I'd do

Chorus
I'd give her more love, more time
More of her knowing that she's on my mind
More of my heart would have suited her fine
Cause that's what she was dreaming of
She needed more love, more time
Less of the things that money could buy
More of my arms just holding her tight
When it all adds up to the bottom line
The answer's the same every time
Of all that she was dreaming of
She only needed more love

Tag
I nearly gave her enough
She only needed more love
