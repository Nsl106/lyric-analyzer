I said, "Hello, my its been such a long time"
You said, "Yes, it has, its been a year or more"
Then you smiled and asked about my wife and family
I said, "Johnny's six and Judy's almost four"

But I was thinking how I'd love to get you alone for one hour
Down at the Family Inn like we used to do
We kept talking like nothing ever happened
But I was making small talk, thinking of a rendezvous

You said, "Are you still working down at the factory"
I said, "Yes I am, guess I'll be there 'til I die"
You asked me if I still went down to Joe's Place
I said, "Ya, I do, but it's been a long, long time"

But I was thinking how I'd love to get you alone for one hour
Down at the Family Inn like we used to do
We kept talking like nothing ever happened
But I was making small talk, thinking of a rendezvous

And you said, "Gotta go, sure been nice to see you
But I told Jack that I'd be home by nine"
I said, "By the way, tell him I said hello
And we'll all have to get together sometime"

But I was thinking how I'd love to get you alone for one hour
Down at the Family Inn like we used to do
We kept talking like nothing ever happened
But I was making small talk, thinking of a rendezvous
