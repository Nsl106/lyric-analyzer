In a little cafe on the other side of the border
She was sitting there giving me looks that made my mouth water
So I started walking her way, she be-longed to Bad Man Jose
And I knew, yes I knew, I should leave, then I heard her say - ay - ay

CHORUS:
.. Come a little bit closer, you're my kind of man, so big and so
Strong
Come a little bit closer, I'm all a-lone, and the night is
So long
So we started to dance, in my arms she felt so in-viting
And I just couldn't resist, a-just a-one little kiss so ex-citing
Then I heard the guitar player say: Va-moose , Jose's on his way
And I knew , yes I knew, I should run, but then I heard her say
Then the music stopped, when I looked, the cafe was empty
And I heard Jose say: Man, you know you're in trouble plenty
So I dropped the drink from my hand, and out through the window I ran
And as I rode a-way, I could hear her say to Jos - e - yay - yay
