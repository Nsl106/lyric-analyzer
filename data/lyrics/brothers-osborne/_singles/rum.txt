[Verse 1]
Starin' at the prettiest part of this powder keg world
Sittin' with the finest example of a beautiful girl
If we hadn't hit the brakes, we'd have no idea
Paradise was hiding right here

[Chorus]
Dipping our toes in the water
I don't care if it gets any hotter
It's you, and me rememberin' how to have fun
Let's put our hearts together
Two parts love and a pinch of good weather
And top it all off with the sun
And mix it with rum, mmm mmm mm-mm

[Verse 2]
Came out here to do a whole lot of nothing
And we're doing pretty good I think
The only one thing we need to worry about
Is filling up when the ice cubes clink

[Chorus]
Dipping our toes in the water
I don't care if it gets any hotter
It's you, and me remembering how to have fun
Let's put our hearts together
Two parts love and a pinch of good weather
And top it all off with the sun
And mix it with rum, mmm mmm mm-mm
Mix it with rum, mmm mmm mm-mm

[Bridge]
Lucky folks go to the ocean
The lakes for the land-locked ones
We got a tarp and a truck bed
A kiddie pool, a slip and slide
Let that garden hose run

[Chorus]
Dipping our toes in the water
I don't care if it gets any hotter
It's you, and me remembering how to have fun
Let's put our hearts together
Two parts love and a pinch of good weather
And top it all off with the sun
And mix it with rum, mmm mmm-mm-mm
And mix it with rum, mmm mmm mm-mm
And mix it with rum, mmm mmm mm-mm
