[Verse 1]
Don't give me that look, that let-me-down-easy smile
Don't act like I couldn't see you comin' for a hundred miles
Don't try to find the perfect words, can't take the pain out of the hurt
Hit me hard, baby, I can take it, it's your move, go on and make it

[Chorus]
Make it burn the whole way down
Lay my six-foot-four-inch ass out on the ground
Yeah, tomorrow, I'll have me a hard hangover and one hell of a heartache
So pour it on like a shot of whiskey and shoot me straight

[Verse 2]
I've got some friends who'd love to go raise some hell
A couple old flames to help me bid you farewell
There's plenty of time and alcohol from happy hour to last call
So do whatcha gotta do so I can get to gettin' over you and

[Chorus]
Make it burn the whole way down
Lay my six-foot-four-inch ass out on the ground
Yeah, tomorrow, I'll have me a hard hangover and one hell of a heartache
So pour it on like a shot of whiskey and shoot me straight

[Bridge]
Don't give me that salt shaker and lime
Don't give me that come-back chaser this time
Don't muddle it up, don't water it down
Give me everything you got right here, right now
And make it burn

[Chorus]
Make it burn the whole way down
Lay my six-foot-four-inch ass out on the ground
Yeah, tomorrow, I'll have me a hard hangover and one hell of a heartache
Pour it on like a shot of whiskey and shoot me straight

[Post-Chorus]
Shoot me straight, come on
(Come on, come on, come on, come on now)
Yeah
