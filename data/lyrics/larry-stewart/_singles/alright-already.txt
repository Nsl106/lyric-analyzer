[Chorus]
She's alright already, she's back on her feet
It didn't take her long to get over me
My heart's still hurting, but what's killing me
She's alright already and I'm just a memory

[Verse 1]
There I stood with flowers in hand
Hoping to dry her tears
She walked out that door with him
Grinning from ear to ear

[Chorus]
She's alright already, she's back on her feet
It didn't take her long to get over me
My heart's still hurting, but what's killing me
She's alright already and I'm just a memory

[Fiddle Solo]

[Verse 2]
She said there would never be anyone else
No one could fill my shoes
Now she's using that same old line
Snuggled up to someone new

[Chorus]
She's alright already, she's back on her feet
It didn't take her long to get over me
My heart's still hurting, but what's killing me
She's alright already and I'm just a memory
She's alright already and I'm just a memory
