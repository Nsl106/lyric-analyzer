[Verse 1]
I haven't been myself these days according to friends
I tend to lose a part of me when my heart is on the mend
I'll be alright, it's safe to say
'Cause just like your love, this is only a phase

[Chorus]
Well, I've been down this road a time or two
It's nothin' new
Well, I'll get on my feet and over you
I tell myself that everything will be just fine
Oh, I'm just goin' through a little downtime

[Verse 2]
Some might think I've gotten caught up in heartache's aftermath
But your memory's taken second to a good book and nice long bath
I must admit, it threw me at first
But I'm convinced I'm over the worst

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been down this road a time or two
It's nothin' new
Oh, I'll get on my feet and over you
I tell myself that everything will be just fine
Oh, I'm just goin' through a little downtime

[Bridge]
Well, time is meant to play the part
In taking care of broken hearts

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been down this road a time or two (Down this road)
It's nothin' new (Nothin' new)
Oh, I'll get on my feet and over you
Oh, I tell myself that everything will be just fine
Oh, I'm just goin' through a little
Oh, I'm just goin' through a little
I'm just goin' through a little downtime
