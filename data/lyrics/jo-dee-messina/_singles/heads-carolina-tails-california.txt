[Verse 1]
Baby, what do you say we just get lost?
Leave this one-horse town like two rebels without a cause
I've got people in Boston, ain't your Daddy still in Des Moines?
We can pack up tomorrow, tonight let's flip a coin

[Chorus]
Heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where, it don't matter as long as we're going
Somewhere together, I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina, tails California

[Verse 2]
We can load what we own in the back of a U-Haul van
Couple of modern day Moses' searching for the promised land
We can go four hundred miles before we stop for gas
We can drive for a day and then we'll take a look at the map

[Chorus]
Heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where, it don't matter as long as we're going
Somewhere together, I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina, tails California

[Bridge]
We're gonna get outta here
If we have to ride a Greyhound bus
Boy, we're bound to outrun
The bad luck that's been tailing us

[Chorus]
Heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where, it don't matter as long as we're going
Somewhere together, I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina, tails California

[Refrain]
Ohh California, Carolina, California
