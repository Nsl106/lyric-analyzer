[Verse 1]
He said I grew up near Wichita
In a Mayberry kinda town
He never liked overalls
Or haulin' hay 'til sundown
He said he dreamed about LA as he plowed away the day
On an old John Deere
I said, "Boy let me warn ya, in southern California
There's some fast trains here"

[Chorus]
You're not in Kansas anymore
Can't be too careful, that's for sure
City lights will lead you on
Mornin' comes and they'll be gone
So write my number on your wall
And call me anytime at all
I'm so happy now, boy
You're not in Kansas anymore

[Verse 2]
He said, "Do you know where Carson lives?"
So we drove up to Malibu
Cruisin' down Sunset Strip
Oh, I let him steal a kiss or two
Under the Hollywood sign, I tried to hide a smile
As I whispered low
"I wanna be the first to tell ya
Here we say Rodeo, not rodeo"

[Chorus]
You're not in Kansas anymore
Can't be too careful, that's for sure
City lights will lead you on
Mornin' comes and they'll be gone
So write my number on your wall
And call me anytime at all
I'm so happy now, boy
You're not in Kansas anymore
I'm so happy now, boy
You're not in Kansas anymore
