[Verse 1: Hank Williams Jr.]
If the wife and I are fussin', brother, that's all right
'Cause me and that woman bought a license to fight

[Chorus: Hank Williams Jr.]
Why don't you mind your own business
Mind your own business
'Cause if you mind your business
Then you won't be mindin' mine

[Verse 2: Reba McEntire]
Oh, the man in the apartment, he's a nosy thing
He comes to my door and it's a ring, ring, ring

[Chorus: Reba McEntire]
You, mind your own business
Hey, won't you mind your own business
'Cause if you mind your own business
Then you won't be mindin' mine

[Verse 3: Tom Petty]
Yeah, I got a little girl, wears her hair up high
The boys all quiver when she walks by

[Chorus: Tom Petty]
You better mind your own business
Yes, mind your own business
If you mind your own business
Then you won't be mindin' mine

[Verse 4: Reverend Ike]
Mindin' other people's business seems to be high tone
I got all that I can do, I'm mindin' my own

[Chorus: Reverend Ike]
Why don't you mind your own business
Mind your own business
'Cause if you mind your business
You won't be mindin' mine

[Verse 5: Willie Nelson]
I may tell a lotta stories that may not be true
But I can get to Heaven just as easily as you

[Chorus: Willie Nelson]
So, won't you mind your own business
Mind your own business
'Cause if you mind your business
Then you won't be mindin' mine

[Verse 6: Hank Williams Jr.]
Hey, if I wanna honky-tonk around to two or three
Baby, that's my headache, don't you worry about me

[Chorus: Hank Williams Jr.]
Just mind your own business
Mind your own business
Well, if you mind your business
You'll be busy all the time
