[Verse 1]
Well, my mama met my daddy down in Alabam'
They tied the knot so here I am
Born on the bayou on the Texas line
Loved in Louisiana and raised on Jambalaya

[Verse 2]
Now before I could walk, I had a guitar in my hand
By the time I could talk, I had my own band
I went on the road when I was eight years old
When I turned fifteen, I was stealing the show

[Chorus]
Money to burn and the girls were pretty
It didn't take me long to learn that I was born to boogie

[Verse 3]
When I was eighteen, I went to Hollywood
I met Elvis and Marilyn and Johnny B. Goode
Got my guitar painted and some California sun
A red Cadillac, having too much fun

[Verse 4]
Now we were playing them halls and jamming then
And we moved it on over to MGM
They said, "This is the boy we've been telling you about"
He lit a cigar and stuck his hand out
[Verse 5]
He said, "Son, have we got a deal for you
I'm gonna make you a star
Give you fifty thousand too"
I told him, "My Momma didn't raise no fool"
[Chorus]
"I'll take your money, I'll make your movie
I'll tell you right now I was born to boogie"

[Verse 6]
Well my name is Bocephus, I drink whiskey by the gallon
And I never back down and I love a good challenge
What I do now is what I did then
I like to get down with all my rowdy friends

[Verse 7]
Now I can be sweet and I can be mean
I still got my hat and I still wear my jeans
My shades are chrome, my guitar is steel
If you think I won't then believe me I will

[Chorus]
Get down on you, baby, 'cause I ain't no rookie
I was put here to party and I was born to boogie
