[Verse 1]
When you are sad and lonely
And have no place to go
Come and see me, baby
And bring along some dough

[Chorus 1]
And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'
We'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town

[Verse 2]
If you and your baby
Have a little fallin' out
Call me up, sweet mama
And we'll go steppin' out

[Chorus 2]
And we'll go honky tonkin', honey baby
We'll go honky tonkin', sugar booger
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town

[Verse 3]
Well, I'm goin' in to the city
To the city fair
If you go to the city
I'll be jukebox jumpin' there

[Chorus 3]
And we'll go honky tonkin', hey good lookin'
Honky tonkin', whatcha got cookin'?
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town

[Verse 1]
When you are sad and lonely
And have no place to go
Come and see me, baby
And bring along some dough

[Chorus 3]
And we'll go honky tonkin', hey good lookin'
Honky tonkin', whatcha got cookin'?
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town
