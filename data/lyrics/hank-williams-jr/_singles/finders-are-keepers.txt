[Verse 1]
You're one in a million, a hundred to one shot
I took a gamble and just lookie here what I got
A diamond in the middle of a field full of stone
I'm bettin' everything I got that you can keep me comin' home

[Chorus]
Finders are keepers
And I'm keeping you as long as I can
Finders are keepers
So baby, don't ever stop, just keep on holdin' my hand

[Verse 2]
A needle in a haystack would be easy to do
Compared to me finding somebody else like you
I tell you chasing the perfect woman is just like rolling the dice
She's as pretty as a natural 11 and I'm puttin' my heart on the line

[Chorus]
Finders are keepers
And I'm keeping you as long as I can
Finders are keepers
So baby, don't ever stop, just keep on holdin' my hand

[Refrain]
Finders are keepers
So baby, keep on keepin' on with your lovin' man
