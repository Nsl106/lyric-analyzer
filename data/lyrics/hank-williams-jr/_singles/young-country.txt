[Chorus 1]
We are young country, we are the pride
The sons and the daughters of American life
Our hair is not orange, we don't wear chains and spikes
But we know how to have fun come Saturday night

[Verse 1]
We know what's right, we know what's wrong
We know what we like to hear in a song
We like some of the old stuff, we like some of the new
But we do our own choosing
We pick our own music if you don't mind, thank you

[Chorus 2]
We are young country, we like all kinds
Of music and people 'cause we don't draw no lines
No, our hair is not orange, we don't wear chains and spikes
But we know how to have fun come Saturday night

[Verse 2]
We like old Waylon, hey, we know Van Halen
We like ZZ Top, we like country and rock
Old Hank would be proud and Elvis would too
We like our country mixed with some big city blues

[Chorus 3]
We are young country, we are the pride
The sons and the daughters of American life
Old Hank would be proud and Elvis would too
'Cause we like our country mixed with some rhythm and blues

[Outro]
We know when it's hot
We know when it's not
If you don't mind, thank you
