[Verse 1]
Well, it's Sunday morning
And the sun in shining in my eye that is open
And my head is spinning
Was the life of the party
I can't stop grinning
I had too much tequila last night

[Chorus]
Jose Cuervo
You are a friend of mine
I like to drink you with a little salt and lime
Did I kiss all the cowboys?
Did I shoot out the lights?
Did I dance on the bar?
Did I start any fights?

[Verse 2]
Now wait a minute
Things don't look too familiar
And who is this cowboy who's sleepin' beside me?
Well, he's awful cute
But how'd I get his shirt on?
I had too much tequila last night

[Chorus]
Jose Cuervo
You are a friend of mine
I like to drink you with a little salt and lime
Did I kiss all the cowboys?
Did I shoot out the lights?
Did I dance on the bar?
Did I start any fights?

[Verse 3]
All those little shooters
How I love to drink 'em down
Come on, bartender
Let's have another round
Well, the music is playing and my spirits are high
Tomorrow might be painful
But tonight we're gonna fly

[Bridge]
Jose Cuervo
You are a friend of mine
I like to drink you with a little salt and lime
Every time we get together
I sure have a good time
You're my friend, you're the best, mi amigo
(Tequila)

[Chorus]
Jose Cuervo
You are a friend of mine
I like to drink you with a little salt and lime
Did I kiss all the cowboys?
Did I shoot out the lights?
Did I dance on the bar?
Did I start any fights?

[Outro]
Jose Cuervo, you are a friend of mine
