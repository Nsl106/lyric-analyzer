[Verse 1]
Downtown's getting busy
People everywhere
Stores are decorated, there's Christmas in the air
Santa's getting ready
Kids are counting down
The only thing left to do right now is

[Chorus]
Pick out a Christmas tree
Top shelf in aisle three
We'll tie it to the car
Hey, don't forget the star
And when we get back home
Plug it in and watch it glow
Been waiting all year to
Light up the living room with you, ooh, ooh

[Post-Chorus]
You, ooh, ooh
With you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
We'll line up all the stockings
Hang some mistletoe
Can stay up past our bedtimes
And pray for it to snow until we

[Chorus]
Pick out a Christmas tree
Top shelf in aisle three
We'll tie it to the car
Hey, don't forget the star
And when we get back home
Plug it in and watch it glow
Been waiting all year to
Light up the living room with you, ooh, ooh

[Post-Chorus]
You, ooh, ooh
With you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
So grab your keys and grab your coat
December's here, what you say we go and

[Chorus]
Pick out a Christmas tree
Top shelf in aisle three
We'll tie it to the car
Hey, don't forget the star
And when we get back home
Plug it in and watch it glow
Been waiting all year to
Light up the living room with you, ooh, ooh

[Post-Chorus]
You, ooh, ooh
With you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh (Yeah)
Can't wait to, ooh, ooh

[Outro]
Go pick out a Christmas tree with you
