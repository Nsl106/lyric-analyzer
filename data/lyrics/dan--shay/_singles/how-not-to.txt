[Intro]
I can honestly understand why it's over
I can go through the motions of walking away
I can give you the key and take my things back
I can find plenty things to fill my days

[Chorus]
But I don't know how not to think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who is strong and just moves on
But I'll probably turn down your road, knock knock on your door
Fall back in your arms, wake up in the morning
Hating myself for the way that I can't help the way I still want you

[Post-Chorus]
I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to
I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to

[Verse 1]
You're like second nature baby, you're just like breathin'
A melody that you hear and you can't forget
And time goes by and I still need you
Yeah you're worth the heartbreak and no regret

[Chorus]
But I don't know how not to think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who is strong and just moves on
But I'll probably turn down your road, knock knock on your door
Fall back in your arms, wake up in the morning
Hating myself for the way that I can't help the way I still want you

[Post-Chorus]
I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to
I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to

[Chorus]
I don't know how not to think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
But I know that I ought to be the one who's strong and just moves on
But I'll probably turn down your road, knock knock on your door
Fall back in your arms, wake up in the morning
Hating myself for the way that I can't help the way I still want you

[Post-Chorus]
I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to
I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to

[Outro]
Mmmmmm
Oh-oh-oh-oh
