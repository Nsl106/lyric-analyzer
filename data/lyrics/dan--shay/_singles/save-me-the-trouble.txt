[Verse 1]
I can tell by the way that you're stirrin' your drink
Oh, we're already playin' with fire
Said that you had to go 'bout an hour ago
Baby, you're such a beautiful liar

[Pre-Chorus]
It feels like a movie I've already seen
So right now I'm beggin' you, please

[Chorus]
Why don't you save me the trouble
Keep those pretty blue eyes to yourself
Why don't you save me the trouble
Give that heartache to somebody else
If you're the kinda girl that's only gonna wanna love and leave
A guy like me alone in this bar drinkin' double
Why don't you save me the trouble
Save me the trouble, baby

[Verse 2]
Now the closer I get to the red on your lips
I can feel myself fallin' all crazy
'Cause just a little kiss and I could never get you out of my mind
So before you go wreck my whole life

[Chorus]
Why don't you save me the trouble
Keep those pretty blue eyes to yourself
Why don't you save me the trouble (Save me the trouble, baby)
Give that heartache to somebody else (Somebody else)
If you're the kinda girl that's only gonna wanna love and leave
A guy like me alone in this bar drinkin' double
Why don't you save me the trouble
Save me the trouble, baby

[Post-Chorus]
Oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
I know you know that I ain't strong enough
To tell girls like you no, no it ain't in my blood

[Chorus]
So just save me the trouble
Keep those pretty blue eyes to yourself
Why don't you save me the trouble (Save me the trouble, baby)
Give that heartache to somebody else (Somebody else)
If you're the kinda girl that's only gonna wanna love and leave
A guy like me alone in this bar drinkin' double
Why don't you save me the trouble
Why don't you save me the trouble
Save me the trouble, baby
