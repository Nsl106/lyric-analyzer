[Guitar Solo Intro]

[Verse 1]
(Ah!) You came in like a wolf in sheep's disguise
With silver-tongued promises and hollow lies
You sold us dreams, but you bought our souls
A puppeteer pulling strings, losing control
You took our fire, turned it into ash
While counting coins, you made your stash
With every note we played, you took your cut
But now we’re rising, and you're in the rut

[Chorus]
All of us want to sing
We'll break these chains
All of us want to sing
You thought you
Owned our voice
But we’ve found our veins
The stage is ours
We're taking back the night
With every chord we strum
We'll set this wrong to right (live to die)
Hear our battle cry
You're just a fading echo
As we reach for the sky (Reach sky!)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
(Ah!) You wore a crown
But it was made of thorns
Drowning in greed while
We were left to mourn
You drained our passion
Like a thief in the dark
But now we're lighting up
The world with our spark
You played the game
But we're changing the rules
We've found our strength
No longer your fools
With every scar we wear
We've learned to fight
And now we’re screaming
Taking back our right

We’re free at last!

[Chorus]
All of us want to sing
We'll break these chains
All of us want to sing
You thought you owned our voice (You thought you)
But we’ve found our veins (But we've found)
The stage is ours we're taking back the night
With every chord we strum
We'll set this wrong to right
Hear our battle cry
You’re just a fading echo
As we reach for the sky (for the sky!)
