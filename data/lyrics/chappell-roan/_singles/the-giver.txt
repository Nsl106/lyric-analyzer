[Intro]
(Two, three)

[Verse 1]
Ain't got antlers on my walls
But I sure know mating calls
From the stalls in the bars on a Friday night
And other boys may need a map
But I can close my eyes
And have you wrapped around my fingers like that

[Pre-Chorus]
So, baby
When you need the job done
You can call me, baby

[Chorus]
'Cause you ain't got to tell me
It's just in my nature
So take it like a taker
'Cause, baby, I'm a giver
Ain't no need to hurry
'Cause, baby, I deliver
Ain't no country boy quitter
I get the job done
I get the job done

[Verse 2]
Girl, I don't need no lifted truck
Revvin' loud to pick you up
'Cause how I look is how I touch
And in this strip-mall town of dreams
Good luck finding a man who has the means
To rhinestone cowgirl all night long

[Pre-Chorus]
So, baby
If you never had one
Call me, baby, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause you ain't gotta tell me
It's just in my nature
So take it like a taker
'Cause, baby, I'm a giver
Ain't no need to hurry
'Cause, baby, I deliver
Ain't no country boy quitter
I get the job done
I get the job done

[Bridge]
Na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na (
She gets the job done
)
Na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na (
She gets the job done
)
Na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na

[Chorus]
'Cause you ain't gotta tell me
It's just in my nature
So take it like a taker
'Cause, baby, I'm a giver
Ain't no need to hurry
'Cause, baby, I deliver
Ain't no country boy quitter
I get the job done
I get the job done

[Outro]
I get the job done
I get the job done
I get the job done
Yes, ma'am, yes, I do
You're welcome
