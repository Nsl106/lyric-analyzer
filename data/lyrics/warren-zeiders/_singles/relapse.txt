[Chorus]
So maybe we should relapse, relapse
Drink us one or two or three Jacks, go back
Baby, I ain't talking rehab
I'm talking what we had when you were mine
Love that look in your eye
I'm undressing you in my head, my bed
Ain't had no one on your side yet, I'd wreck
Midnight into morning with you
Ain't nobody get you like I do
So maybe we should

[Verse]
Call each other, blame it on another "it's late"
Girl, I wonder, should we make another mistake?
Under covers, I say I'm recovered
I'd change that in a heartbeat just to feel your body

[Pre-Chorus]
Next to me tonight
That's the ecstasy I like

[Chorus]
So maybe we should relapse, relapse
Drink us one or two or three Jacks, go back
Baby, I ain't talking rehab
I'm talking what we had when you were mine
Love that look in your eye
I'm undressing you in my head, my bed
Ain't had no one on your side yet, I'd wreck
Midnight into morning with you
Ain't nobody get you like I do (Like I do)
So maybe we should relapse, woah-oh
So maybe we should relapse, woah-oh

[Bridge]
I need you next to me tonight
That's the ecstasy I like

[Chorus]
Maybe we should relapse, relapse
Drink us one or two or three Jacks, go back
Baby, I ain't talking rehab
I'm talking what we had when you were mine
Love that look in your eye
I'm undressing you in my head, my bed
Ain't had no one on your side yet, I'd wreck
Midnight into morning with you
Ain't nobody get you like I do (Like I do)
So maybe we should relapse, relapse, woah-oh
