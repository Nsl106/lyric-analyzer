[Verse 1]
Mama always said I was born on the wild side
One foot in the flames and the other trying to walk the line
Can't say I never saw it coming, I could see the warning signs
Mama always said I was born on the wild side
I guess mama was right
'Cause when the clock strikes midnight

[Chorus]
Gonna ride the lightning, feel the thunder
'Til the darkness pulls me under
Gonna fly on wings of fire
Pray the good Lord lifts me higher
Singing, "Oh, when they call me home"
Singing, "Oh, when they call me home"
I'm gonna ride the lightning

[Verse 2]
Therе's a man in a black coat standing at a crossroads
With a pad in his hand and a long list of lost souls
They say he flips a coin forged out of fool's gold
Thеre's a man in black coat standing at a crossroads
I hope he lets me pass by
And I close my eyes

[Chorus]
I'm gonna ride the lightning, feel the thunder
'Til the darkness pulls me under
Gonna fly on wings of fire
Pray the good Lord lifts me higher
Singing, "Oh, when they call me home"
Singing, "Oh, when they call me home"
I'm gonna ride the lightning, ride the lightning, ride the lightning

[Outro]
I'm gonna ride the lightning, feel the thunder
'Til the darkness pulls me under
Gonna fly on wings of fire
Pray the good Lord lifts me higher
Singing, "Oh, when they call me home"
Singing, "Oh, when they call me home"
I'm gonna ride the lightning
