If you feel teardrops
Falling like rain on the rooftops
If you don't know what you're listening to
This is me missing you

If you seem lonely
Clear sky is turning stormy
Lightning strikes and all you see is blue
This is me missing you

(Chorus)
And while you're gone, this is the only way
To let you know your love is always safe

If you feel heartbreak
Distant thunder like an earthquake
If you wonder why the earth moves
This is me missing you

And while you're gone, this is the only way
To let you know your love is always safe

If you touch empty
Reach in the darkness and don't find me
Then you'll know just what I'm going through
This is me missing you
