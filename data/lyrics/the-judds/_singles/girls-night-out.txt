[Verse 1]
Friday finally came around
This girl's ready to paint the town
Tonight, ain't nothin' gonna slow me down
I did my time workin' all week
Tonight's all mine, tomorrow I'll sleep
I wanna hear a band with a country sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I've been cooped up all week long
I've been workin' my fingers to the bone

[Chorus]
Well, it's a girls' night out
Honey, there ain't no doubt
I'm gonna dance every dance 'til the boys go home
Well, it's my night to rock
No watchin' that ol' clock
Oh, ain't no doubt, Lordy, it's a girls' night out

[Verse 2]
Two-step or the Cotton Eyed Joe
They can play 'em fast or they can play 'em slow
I can do 'em all, just show me the floor
You can give me a little rock 'n' roll
Or even a waltz with the lights down low
I'll still be dancin' when they close the door

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I've been cooped up all week long
I've been workin' my fingers to the bone

[Chorus]
Well, it's a girls' night out
Honey, there ain't no doubt
I'm gonna dance every dance 'til the boys go home
Well, it's my night to rock
No watchin' that ol' clock
Oh, ain't no doubt, Lordy, it's a girls' night out
Well, it's a girls' night out
Honey, there ain't no doubt
I'm gonna dance every dance 'til the boys go home
Well, it's my night to rock
No watchin' that ol' clock
Oh, ain't no doubt, Lordy, it's a girls' night out

[Outro]
Friday finally came around
This girl's ready to paint the town
Tonight, ain't nothin' gonna slow me down
I did my time workin' all week
Tonight's all mine, tomorrow I'll sleep
I wanna hear a band with a country sound
