[Verse 1]
There's one hundred and one
Little reasons why
I should leave you here
Say goodbye
But I just can't seem
To say we're through
And the reasons why
Are one hundred and two

[Verse 2]
One hundred and one
Little tears fall
And every drop
Mm, makes me feel so small
But hard as I try
I can't leave you
And the reasons why, baby
Are one hundred and two

[Bridge]
I'm countin' up
The times I've cried
The times you'd leave
The times you lied
And everyday
I'm keeping score
When it all adds up
I need you more

[Verse 3]
One hundred and one
Lonely nights
You leave me here
Now, honey, that ain't right
But still I forgive
Everything you do
And the reasons why
Are one hundred and two
Yeah, the reasons why, baby
Are one hundred and two

[Outro]
There's one hundred and one
Little reasons why
But one hundred and two
Keeps me by your side
Mm, yeah
