[Verse 1]
Love ain't a candle
It doesn't burn for one night and need the dark to shine
Love is alive
And love ain't just a word in every dictionary
With nowhere defined
Love is a man and he's mine

[Chorus]
Love is alive and at our breakfast table
Every day of the week
Love is alive and it grows every day and night
Even in our sleep
Love is alive and it's made a happy woman out of me
Oh, love is alive
And here by me

[Verse 2]
Love ain't just a mood
A distant far away dream that needs the night to rise
Love is alive
And love ain't just a song
Sweet words of music to go dancin' by
Love is a man and he's mine

[Chorus]
Love is alive and at our breakfast table
Every day of the week
Love is alive and it grows every day and night
Even in our sleep
Love is alive and it's made a happy woman out of me
Oh, love is alive
And here by me
Oh, love is alive and at our breakfast table
Every day of the week
Love is alive and it grows every day and night
Even in our sleep
Love is alive and it's made a happy woman out of me
Oh, love is alive
And here by me

[Outro]
Love is alive
Here by me
Love is alive
Here by me
