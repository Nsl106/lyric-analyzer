[Verse 1]
Some call it country with a little bit of rhythm and blues
And when the boys start rockin', there's a beat that you just can't lose
Where it's gonna take us, nobody knows
It sure feels good to the body and soul

[Chorus]
I love the slide of a steel guitar
I love the moan, moan, moan of an old blues harp
I love the shake of a tambourine
I love the bass when it's low and mean
So put on your shoutin' shoes and turn it loose
Turn it loose

[Verse 2]
You feel like dancin' and you just can't stay in your seat
Your knees start knockin' and you can't help stompin' your feet
Before you even know it, you'll be singin' along
It makes me wanna stay here all night long

[Chorus]
I love the slide of a steel guitar
I love the moan, moan, moan of an old blues harp
I love the shake of a tambourine
I love the bass when it's low and mean
So put on your shoutin' shoes and turn it loose
Turn it loose

[Interlude]
Uh
Woo

[Chorus]
I love the slide of a steel guitar
I love the moan, moan, moan of an old blues harp
I love the shake of a tambourine
I love the bass when it's low and mean
So put on your shoutin' shoes and turn it loose
Turn it loose

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, turn it loose
Everybody put on your shoutin' shoes and turn it loose
Rrr, grab your shoutin' shoes
And turn it loose, uh
