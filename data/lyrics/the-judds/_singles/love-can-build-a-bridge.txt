[Verse 1]
I'd gladly walk across the desert with no shoes upon my feet
To share with you the last bite of bread I had to eat
I would swim out to save you in your sea of broken dreams
When all your hopes are sinkin', let me show you what love means

[Chorus]
Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time?

[Verse 2]
I would whisper love so loudly, every heart could understand
That love and only love can join the tribes of man
I would give my heart's desire, so that you might see
The first step is to realize that it all begins with you and me

[Chorus]
Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time?

[Post-Chorus]
Don't you think it's time?

[Bridge]
When we stand together
It's our finest hour
We can do anything (Anything), anything (Anything)
Keep believin' in the power

[Chorus]
Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time? (Yeah, yes, I do)
Oh, love can build a bridge (Oh, love and only love)
Between your heart and mine (Between your heart and mine)
Love can build a bridge (Love and only love)
Don't you think it's time?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, don't you think it's time?
Mm
Don't you think it's time?

[Outro]
Love and only love
Yeah
Love and only love
