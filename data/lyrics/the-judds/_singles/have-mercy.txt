[Verse 1]
Well, I was standin' in line at the city bus stop
Soaked to the skin from every raindrop
I see you drivin' by just like a phantom jet
With your arm around some little brunette
You say you won't be home because you're workin' late
Honey, I'm no fool, you've been out on a date
The lipstick on your collar gives your game away
It's strawberry red and mine's pink roses

[Chorus]
Have mercy on me
You treat me so bad, I'm in misery
It's breakin' my heart, can't you see?
Baby, baby, have mercy on me

[Verse 2]
Well, I called you up on the telephone
I could hear you was playin' Haggard and Jones
I knew right then that there was somethin' wrong
There's only one reason you play cheatin' songs

[Chorus]
Have mercy on me
You treat me so bad, I'm in misery
It's breakin' my heart, can't you see?
Baby, baby, have mercy on me, yeah

[Interlude]
Woo

[Verse 3]
Well, I went to the bank with my little checkbook
The cashier, he gave me the strangest look
He said, "You ain't got no money 'cause you're overdrawn
Your man took it all and he's a, a-done gone"

[Chorus]
Have mercy on me
You treat me so bad, I'm in misery
It's breakin' my heart, can't you see?
Baby, baby, have mercy on me
Have mercy on me
You treat me so bad, I'm in misery
It's breakin' my heart, can't you see?
Baby, baby, have mercy on me, oh

[Outro]
Have mercy
Have mercy on me
You treat me so bad, I'm in misery
It's breakin' my heart, honey, can't you see?
Baby, baby, have mercy on me
Ow
Have mercy, baby
