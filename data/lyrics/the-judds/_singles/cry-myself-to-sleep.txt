[Verse 1]
I tried so hard
You know I can't do more
It's the turn of the card
It's the close of the door
The lies you told
You know they hurt so deep

[Chorus]
So I'll go home, home
And cry myself to sleep

[Verse 2]
And day after day
You've been treating me bad
Friends come up and say
"Why do you take all that?"
'Cause it's makin' me moan
And it's making me weep

[Chorus]
So I'll go home, home
And cry myself to sleep

[Bridge]
You play at love
Like a child plays games
One day I'm in, then I'm out again
You change the rules and I just can't win
You've broken me no, so I give in
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
I've been through worse
But I don't know what
Oh, I gave to you
Everything that I got
So take this heart
Or what's left to keep

[Chorus]
And I'll go home, home
And cry myself to sleep
So I'll go home, home
And cry myself to sleep

[Outro]
Cry myself to sleep
Cry myself to sleep
Cry myself to sleep, uh
Cry myself to sleep
Cry myself to sleep
