[Chorus]
Well, I'm a one-man woman
I want a one-woman man
I've got two arms to hold him
To love him all I can
Now it's a free world we live in
It's this I understand
But I'm a one-man woman
I want a one-woman man

[Verse 1]
I don't need nobody
Handin' me those lines
Sayin' I can keep my freedom
In these modern times
I want a ring on my finger
All the world to see
And when I get home from workin'
He'll be waitin' there for me

[Chorus]
Well, I'm a one-man woman
I want a one-woman man
I've got two arms to hold him
To love him all I can
Now it's a free world we live in
It's this I understand
But I'm a one-man woman
I want a one-woman man, ooh

[Verse 2]
I don't want nobody
Pullin' me around
Loving me then leavin'
For someone else downtown
If he ain't true and steady
Then he ain't in my plans
'Cause I'm a one-man woman
I want a one-woman man

[Chorus]
Well, I'm a one-man woman
I want a one-woman man
I've got two arms to hold him
To love him all I can
Now it's a free world we live in
It's this I understand
But I'm a one-man woman
I want a one-woman man
Yeah, I'm a one-man woman
I want a one-woman man
