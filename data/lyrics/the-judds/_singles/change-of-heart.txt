[Verse 1]
When you were mine
I was still playing
And promises I made
Were just words I was saying
I was playing you for a fool
Breaking love's precious rule
I did you so wrong
Guess you knew all along

[Verse 2]
That I had my boss lie for me
To say I was working late
And my friends alibied for me
When I'd slip out to meet a date
But, baby, now I see
I was only cheating me
Before you go
I just want you to know

[Chorus]
That I've had a change of heart
I've had a, had a change of heart
I see what I put you through
And I'll make it up to you
I've had a change of heart

[Verse 3]
I've just got to show you
How differently I feel
That I can be true to you
That my love is real
But my past will forever haunt me
If you say that you don't want me
I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please
Won't you?

[Chorus]
Have a change of heart
Please have a, have a change of heart
I see what I put you through
I'll make it up to you
Please have a change of heart, woah, woah
Please have a change of heart
Please have a change of heart
