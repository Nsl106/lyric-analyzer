I was young, he was old
And we both were the same age
Everyday playing fetch, shaking hands
He'd lick my face

And I was unaware
The day would come
Then he died
For the first I knew what real pain was

And I was never was the same again
From that moment on
Real life began

Senior high, girlfriends
Football games, graduation
Summer break, spend my time
Filling out applications

A few superficial years went by

They were all a blur
In the most unlikely situation
There you were

And I never was the same again
From that moment on
Real life began
With you
With you

By your side, scared to death
Felt the pain, you were fighting
Placed my palm on your head
Spoke your name, just keep trying

Then you closed your eyes and took one last breath
When it was over you looked up
Laid our baby across your breast

And I never was the same again
From that moment on
Real life began
