[Intro]
Dum-de-de-dum, de-de-dum-de-de-dum, de-daa-daaaaa
Dum-de-de-dum, de-de-dum-de-de-dum, de-daa-daa-daa-daa-daaaa!

[Verse 1]
Well, I walk into the room
Passing out hundred dollar bills
And it kills and it thrills like the horns on my Silverado grill
And I buy the bar a double round of Crown
And everybody's getting down
And this town ain't never gonna be the same

[Chorus]
'Cause I saddle up my horse and I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise 'cause the girls, they are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway on my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
Everybody says
Save a horse, ride a cowboy

[Verse 2]
Well I don't give a dang about nothing
I'm singing and bling-blinging
While the girls are drinking long necks down!
And I wouldn't trade ol' Leroy
Or my Chevrolet for your Escalade
Or your freak parade
I'm the only John Wayne left in this town

[Chorus]
And I saddle up my horse and I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise 'cause the girls, they are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway on my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
Everybody says
Save a horse, ride a cowboy

[Bridge]
I'm a thoroughbred, that's what she said
In the back of my truck bed
As I was gettin' buzzed on suds
Out on some back country road
We were flying high, fine as wine
Having ourselves a big and rich time
And I was going just about as far as she'd let me go
But her evaluation of my cowboy reputation
Had me begging for salvation all night long
So I took her out giggin frogs
Introduced her to my old bird dog
And sang her every Willie Nelson song I could think of
And we made love

[Chorus]
And I saddle up my horse and I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise 'cause the girls, they are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway on my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
Everybody says
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
What? What?
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
Everybody says
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
