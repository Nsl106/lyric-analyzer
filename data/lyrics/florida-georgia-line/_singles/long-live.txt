[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's a Friday night, we circled up
It’s going down 'round these pick up trucks
Yeah, it's cold cans and Dixie cups
Just out here doin’ what we've always done

[Chorus]
Long live all the small towners, sunup to sundowners
That old school Haggard and Hank
Long live longneck bottles and wide-open throttles
And old dirt roads with no name
Long live them country girls, long legs and cut up jeans
Long live this way of life, long live nights like these
Long live, long live, long live
Long live nights like these

[Verse 2]
Long live the Walmart, parking lot
Turning to thе midnight party spot
Long live hard work, when it pays off
And living it up on your days off

[Chorus]
Long live all thе small towners, sunup to sundowners
That old school Haggard and Hank
Long live longneck bottles and wide-open throttles
And old dirt roads with no name
Long live them country girls, long legs and cut up jeans
Long live this way of life, long live nights like these
Long live, long live, long live
Long live nights like these

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Long live them glory days, on them back forty days
All them pass it 'round, pass it down story days

[Chorus]
Long live all the small towners, sunup to sundowners
That old school Haggard and Hank
Long live longneck bottles and wide-open throttles
And old dirt roads with no name
Long live them country girls, long legs and cut up jeans
Long live this way of life, long live nights like these
Long live, long live, long live
Long live nights like these
