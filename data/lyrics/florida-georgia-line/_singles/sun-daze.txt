[Intro]
Alright
Make you wanna dance, don't it, baby?

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna wear my flip flops and
I'm gonna play some flip cup and
Rock a little bit of hip-hop and Haggard and Jagger
Then throw a twenty on the cornhole game
If I'm lucky, yeah, I might get laid
The way that it's goin', that keg gon' be floatin'

[Chorus]
But all I wanna do today
Is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace
My J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my laid back, ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on

[Post-Chorus]
Gettin' my sun daze on

[Verse 2]
Girl, you know you're the life of my party
You can stay and keep sippin' Bacardi
Stir it up as we turn on some Marley
If you want, you can pet on my Harley
I'll sit you up on a kitchen sink
And stick the pink umbrella in your drink
The way that we're feelin', we gone by this evenin'

[Chorus]
But all I wanna do today
Is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace
My J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my laid back, ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on

[Post-Chorus]
Gettin' my sun daze on
Take 'em out to the sticks, boys, come on

[Chorus]
All I wanna do today
Is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace
My J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my laid back, ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on

[Post-Chorus]
Gettin' my sun daze on
Gettin' my sun daze on
