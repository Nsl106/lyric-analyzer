All those untold stories
All those silent lies
We'll never know each other
Keeping them deep inside
Let's wash away the troubles
Keeping us apart
Tell those untold stories
Let the healing start

It's been so long ago
That we went our separate ways
Now maybe time has changed us
And worn the hurt away
You look the same as ever
I'm glad you're here with me
Take a look into my eyes
And tell me what you see

All those untold stories
All those silent lies
We'll never know each other
Keeping them deep inside
Let's wash away the troubles
Keeping us apart
Tell those untold stories
Let the healing start

Now, I don't want forgiveness
Honey, I don't need you now
We've built a wall between us
And it's time to tear it down
Well, let's plant a tree together
Maybe we can make it grow
If not now then maybe never
We might not ever know about

All those untold stories
All those silent lies
We'll never know each other
Keeping them deep inside
Let's wash away the troubles
Keeping us apart
Tell those untold stories
Let the healing start

Well, let's wash away the troubles
Keeping us apart
Tell those untold stories
Let the healing start
