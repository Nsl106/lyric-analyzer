[Verse 1]
The key's in the mailbox, the U-Haul is loaded
This is the last time we'll call this place home
The cat's in a cage to leave at your mother's
I'll be halfway to Asheville when you wake up alone

[Verse 2]
It's been a while since I've seen Carolina
It always was pretty this time of year
And if this is the end of life as we knew it
You won't find me living around here

[Chorus]
I love life as we knew it
I still can't believe we threw it away
Goodbye that's all there is to it
Life as we knew it ended today

[Verse 3]
I'll leave a number if you need to reach me
You always called when I had to be gone
I know that here in my memory
Life as we knew it still lives on

[Chorus]
I love life as we knew it
I still can't believe we threw it away
Goodbye that's all there is to it
Life as we knew it ended today
Life as we knew it ended today
