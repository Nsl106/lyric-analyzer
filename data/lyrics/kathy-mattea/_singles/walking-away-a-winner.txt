Any time love is on the table the stakes are high
But I thought this was love so I laid it all on the line
You nearly took everything I had
Never knew I could hurt so bad
But at least I left with every pieace of this heart of mine

(Chorus)
I'm walking away a winner
I'm walking away from a losing game
With my pride intact and my vision back I can say
I know where I'm going and I know I'll be alright
I'm walking away a winner
Walking back into my life

It was a hard way to go when I didn't know when to leave
If you knew all along baby you weren't telling me
Now I know I could live or die
I'm heading down the right road now
Still believeing in a way
That a real love is meant to be

(Chorus)
I'm walking away a winner
I'm walking away from a losing game
With my pride intact and my vision back I can say
I know where I'm going and I know I'll be alright
I'm walking away a winner
Walking back into my life

I'm walking away a winner
I'm walking away from a losing game
With my pride intact and my vision back I can say
I know where I'm going and I know I'll be alright
I'm walking away a winner
Walking back into my life

Walking back into my life
Walking away a winner
Walking back into my life
Walking away a winner
