[Chorus]
She came from Fort Worth, Fort Worth couldn't hold her
Her dreams were bigger than the Texas sky
She's got a one-way ticket on the next bus for Boulder
And it won't take long to say goodbye

[Verse 1]
She was workin' at a diner just a week ago
When a man from Colorado smiled and said, "hello"
And he turned her head with stories about a cabin in the trees
Where the wind can sing you love songs
Beneath snow-capped mountain peaks

[Verse 2]
Now she's packed her faded blue jeans and her favorite cowboy boots
Left her apron at the diner for someone else to use
One last look in the mirror at the girl she used to be
Then the driver takes her ticket and she tries to fall asleep

[Chorus]
She came from Fort Worth, Fort Worth couldn't hold her
Her dreams were bigger than the Texas sky
She's got a one-way ticket on the next bus for Boulder
And it won't take long to say goodbye

[Verse 3]
And somewhere in the long, dark night, the snow began to fall
Oh, the world outside was sparkling white when she heard the driver call
"Everyone off now for Boulder and have a real nice day"
He was waitin' on the platform and he raised his hand to wave

[Bridge]
And she offered no resistance as he took her to his cabin
And that diner in the distance seemed just like it never happened

[Chorus]
She came from Fort Worth, Fort Worth couldn't hold her
Her dreams were bigger than the Texas sky
She's got a one-way ticket on the next bus for Boulder
And it won't take long to say goodbye

[Tag]
She's got a one-way ticket on the next bus for Boulder
And it won't take long to say goodbye, bye bye
