[Verse 1]
Pardon me, I don't mean to pry
I saw the tears falling from your eyes, and I thought
You're too pretty not to wear a smile
Hope you don't mind if I sit down for awhile

[Chorus]
'Cause I want tequila little time with you
A little salt and a lime will do
Hey bar man, will you bring us two?
I want tequila little time with you
Talkin' it all out
Seein' what you're all about
I hope you're wantin' tequila little time with me too

[Verse 2]
We don't have to talk about the past
Here's to moving forward and not looking back
Little later, we can take it to the dance floor
But until then, let's order a couple more

[Chorus]
'Cause I want tequila little time with you
A little salt and a lime will do
Hey bar man, will you bring us two?
I want tequila little time with you
Talkin' it all out
Seein' what you're all about
I hope you're wantin' tequila little time with me too

[Bridge]
It's good to see you laughin'
I guess this had to happen
Now let's just get to dancin'

[Chorus]
'Cause I want tequila little time with you
A little salt and a lime will do
Hey bar man, will you bring us two?
I want tequila little time with you
Talkin' it all out
Seein' what you're all about
I hope you're wantin' tequila little time with me too

[Outro]
Hope you're wantin' tequila little time with me too
Hope you're wantin' tequila little time with me too, oh
