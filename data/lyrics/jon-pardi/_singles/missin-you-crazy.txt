[Verse 1]
Been running this highway like a Greyhound
Ain't nothing left for me to see
And sometimes I just wish that I could break down
And get on back to you and me
Take the next flight and leave this crazy life
Get back home in time to kiss you goodnight

[Chorus]
And, oh, lately all I think about
Oh, is what we could be doing now
Oh, baby, here I go again
Missing you crazy, yeah

[Verse 2]
Sitting here, listening to your sweet voice
Talking on the telephone
It's making me realize I ain't got no choice
Between staying here or getting gone
I'm gonna say goodbye, yeah, I'm gonna fly
Get these arms of mine back where they belong

[Chorus]
Oh, lately all I think about
Oh, is what we could be doing now
Oh, baby, here I go again
Missing you crazy, yeah

[Chorus]
And, oh, lately all I think about
Oh, is what we could be doing now
Oh, baby, here I go again
Oh, baby, here I go again
Missing you crazy, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Missing you crazy, mm
