[Verse 1]
Well there's a nursery rhyme
It's a favorite of mine
About a little girl and some sheep
That she could not find
They told her not to worry
They'd come back
Darlin' you're my Shepard
I'm your little lamb
But you ain't always gonna know where I am
Oh, but don't you worry
I'll come back

[Chorus]
I'll always come back
(Come back) Baby, to you
I'll always run back
Straight to you
I'll never get too far away from you
I'll never get too lost that I can't be found
And I'm never gonna swim too far out, I might drown
And I'll always come back
Come back, baby, to you

[Verse 2]
Well there's a wooden wonder from a way down under
They call a boomerang
If you handle it right
It'll come back
But you must have had me when you were a boy
'Cause you've got the touch that turns me into a toy
And like a boomerang
I'll come back

[Bridge]
Now keep your eyes on the horizon
And when you start to missing me
Just look out your window
And there I'll be

[Chorus]
'Cause I'll always come back
(Come back) Baby to you
I'll always run back
Straight to you
I'll never get too far away from you
I'll never get too lost and I can't be found
And I'm never gonna swim too far out, I might drown
And I'll always come back
Come back, baby, to you
I'll always come back
Come back, baby, to you

[Outro]
(Come back, baby)
(Come back, baby)
(Come back, babe)
(You'll come back)
