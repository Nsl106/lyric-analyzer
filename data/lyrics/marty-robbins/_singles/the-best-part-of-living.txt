When things get rough from day to day for your man
And it's a struggle just to see the long day through
Knowing you will be waiting keeps me going, anticipating
The night with you and the touch of your soft hands

Because the best part of livin' is lovin' you
And it's the drivin' force that keeps me strong in everything I do
And there's nothing more in this whole world
That means as much as your sweet love
'Cause the best part of livin' is lovin' you

Sometimes life's problems seem like mountains I can't climb
But hand in hand our love will always find a way
You're my bridge o'er troubled water you inspire me to try harder
But you're always first, dear, in my heart and mind

Because the best part of livin' is lovin' you
It's the drivin' force that keeps me strong in everything I do
And there's nothing more in this whole world
That means as much as your sweet love
'Cause the best part of livin' is lovin' you
