[Verse 1]
She comes from silver spoon, golden rule, private school, never miss Sunday Church
And I come from blue-collar, low-dollar, out here where concrete meets old red dirt
And I don't know what happened, but it sure don't add up on paper
But when I close my eyes late at night, you can bet I thank my maker

[Chorus]
She keeps on loving me, loves me the way I am
She's not just along for the ride, she's my biggest fan
Lord, it's a little piece of Heavеn when we lay down at night
She keeps on loving mе and I keep on wondering why

[Verse 2]
She's got a wicked smile, angel eyes, every guy wanting to hold her close
She's as pretty as sin like the sun sinking down on the California coast

[Chorus]
She keeps on loving me, loves me the way I am
She's not just along for the ride, she's my biggest fan
Lord, it's a little piece of Heaven when we lay down at night
She keeps on loving me and I keep on wondering why

[Bridge]
I don't know what happened, but it sure don't add up on paper
And as long as she lets me, I'll take her wherever she wants me to take her

[Chorus]
She keeps on loving me, loves me the way I am
She's not just along for the ride, she's my biggest fan
And it's a little piece of Heaven when we lay down at night
But she keeps on loving me and I keep on wondering why
She keeps on loving me and I keep on wondering why
