[Verse 1]
Everybody's waitin' for a break
Like "Fast Cars and Freedom"
Everybody wants the same old things
Tell me what will it bring?
My friend, I'm tired of being this way
I'm tired of runnin' astray
Oh, God, I need to know you're still above

[Chorus]
I just wanna be loved
I just wanna be loved
Can you tell me I'm worthy or important
Am I workin' hard enough?
Oh, I just wanna be loved
I just wanna be loved

[Verse 2]
They say that faith can move a mountain
But I'm built for the climb
So tell me am I faithful or just too stubborn
Tell me what will I find
At the peak, at the top, at the end of the line
And at the end of my life
Oh, tell me how my climb will be judged

[Chorus]
I just wanna be loved
I just wanna be loved
Can you tell me I'm worthy or important
Am I workin' hard enough?
Oh, I just wanna be loved
I just wanna be loved

[Bridge]
I've been afraid
And I've been alone
Sometimes I need someone to pick up the phone
I'm tired of the leavin'
I need a home

[Chorus]
Oh, I just wanna be loved
I just wanna be loved
Can you tell me I'm worthy or important
Am I workin' hard enough?
Oh, I just wanna be loved
I just wanna be loved

[Outro]
And I want someone to want me
I want somebody there
And I need someone to need me
I need someone who cares
