[Verse 1]
Granddaddy drank Heavy, and daddy drank Light
I can turn any day to Saturday night, if I want to
And most the time I want to
I can still paint a picture of a hemlock view
My mountains had smoke, but the ones that were blue that we'd buy then
Were the ones I spent a little more time in
Between the hangovers and the handcuffs
It’s been a minute since I had one in my hand, 'cause

[Chorus]
Everybody says it's gonna be the death of me
But these days I’m livin' on the side of alive
Just 'cause I smile through my sobriеty
Don't mean it ain't chillin' in the back of my mind
I ain't sayin' I swore it off for good
I’m just sayin’ I'm doin’ thе best I can
But what do you expect from a redneck?
Hell, I was born with a beer in my hand

[Verse 2]
When I was puttin' 'em down, they put me through hell
Put some scars on some trucks, myself as well
But if I never did put that can to my mouth
I wouldn't have nothin’ I could sing about

[Chorus]
Yeah, everybody says it's gonna be the death of me
But these days I'm livin' on the side of alive
Just 'cause I smile through my sobriety
Don't mean it ain't chillin' in the back of my mind
I ain't sayin' I swore it off for good
I'm just sayin' I'm doin' the best I can
But what do you expect from a redneck?
Hell, I was born with a beer in my hand
Ah yeah, I was born with a beer in my hand

[Bridge]
Woah, I ain't the devil that I acted like years ago
No, but I'll be back one day, y'all, even though

[Chorus]
Everybody says it's gonna be the death of me
But these days I'm livin' on the side of alive
Just 'cause I smile through my sobriety
Don't mean it ain't chillin' in the back of my mind
I ain't sayin' I swore it off for good
I'm just sayin' I'm doin' the best I can
But what do you expect from a redneck?
Hell, I was born with a beer in my hand
Ah yeah, I was born with a beer in my hand

[Outro]
Born with a beer in my hand
