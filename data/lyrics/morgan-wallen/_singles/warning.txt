[Verse 1]
That neon sign
Hangin' outside that bar
Should've said, "Go home
If you know what's good for your heart"
When she sat down
In that ADPi t-shirt
Should've said, "Watch out
Or boy, you're gonna wind up hurt"
And that label on that whiskey on that shelf
Should've said, "Don't buy no shots for no one else"

[Chorus]
Should've come with a warnin' (Ooh)
Don't sit right there, don't sip on what they're pourin' (You)
Her kiss is gonna kill you in the mornin'
Nah, it ain't gonna end too good
Everythin' about that night I thought I wanted
Should've come with a warnin' (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Should've come with a warnin'

[Verse 2]
Phone just lit up
And it's damn near 2 AM
Oughta be blue lights, or some kind of loud sirens
Sayin', "Don't pick it up, she'll let you down
It's the deep end and you're gonna drown"
And this "You up?" text that she sent me right now

[Chorus]
Should've come with a warnin' (Ooh)
Don't sit right there, don't sip on what they're pourin' (You)
Her kiss is gonna kill you in the mornin'
Nah, it ain't gonna end too good
Everything about that night I thought I wanted
Should've come with a warnin' (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Should've come with a warnin'

[Bridge]
Don't fire it up and hit the headlights
Turn on around at the next red light
I wish somebody would've gave me some damn signs
Yeah, I wish that night

[Outro]
Would've come with a warnin' (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Would've come with a warnin'
Would've come with a warnin' (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Would've come with a warnin'
