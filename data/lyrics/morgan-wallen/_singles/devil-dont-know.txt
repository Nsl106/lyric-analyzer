[Verse 1]
There's a bottle on the King James coaster
Miller Lite full of cigarettes
Too drunk to be hungover
Last night still on my breath
There ain't no startin' over
And this over never ends
I've been tryna drown these demons
I'll be damned if they don't swim

[Chorus]
What's keepin' me up all night is knowin' what's keepin' you up all night
Since I ain't the one holdin' on to you, I'm holdin' on for dear life
Fire and brimstone ain't got nothin' on seein' you with someone else
It's a whole 'nother level, girl, even the devil don't know this kinda hell

[Verse 2]
It ain't the one out of Revelation
Nah, it's way too cold for that
It's the heartbreak that won't stop
Everywhere you're not
And everything I can't get back

[Chorus]
What's keepin' me up all night is knowin' what's keepin' you up all night
Since I ain't the one holdin' on to you, I'm holdin' on for dear life
Fire and brimstone ain't got nothin' on seein' you with someone else
It's a whole 'nother level, girl, even the devil don't know this kinda hell

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
It ain't what I did to get here
Nah, it's everything I didn't
And no, I can't tell you where Heaven is
But I know right where it isn't

[Chorus]
What's keepin' me up all night is knowin' what's keepin' you up all night
Since I ain't the one holdin' on to you, I'm holdin' on for dear life
Fire and brimstone ain't got nothin' on seein' you with someone else
It's a whole 'nother level, girl, even the devil don't know this kinda hell
Don't know that kinda hell

[Outro]
Nah, the devil don't know
