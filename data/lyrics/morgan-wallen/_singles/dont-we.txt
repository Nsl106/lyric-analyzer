[Verse 1]
Wouldn't trade this holler for a stone-cold million dollars
My green all comes blue collar, and I'm all good with that
This world's been changin', but these folks 'round here, they ain't been
They all still windshield wavin' when they slow rollin' past

[Pre-Chorus]
We could live a little higher on the hog
But I don't think that we'd be no better off

[Chorus]
Not everybody got that spot out in the forty
Some ten-point buck they shot, hangin' like a velvet trophy
Fridays in parkin' lots outside of somewhere holy
Not everybody likes this kind of life, but we do, don't we?
Still workin' hard likе my daddy told me
Still keepin' lowkey
Still ridin' high behind thеm low beams
If you don't know about this nowhere, you don't know me
Not everybody thinks we got it made, but we do, don't we?

[Verse 2]
It might be simple, but these two lanes, they're my temple
And that river rollin' gentle wash my worries away
I used to hate it, but I traveled lots of pavement
And there ain't no better places at the end of the day

[Pre-Chorus]
So I pass the plate and thank the Lord He put me here
And pray that times like mine don't ever disappear

[Chorus]
Not everybody got that spot out in the forty
Some ten-point buck they shot, hangin' like a velvet trophy
Fridays in parkin' lots outside of somewhere holy
Not everybody likes this kind of life, but we do, don't we?
Still workin' hard like my daddy told me
Still keepin' lowkey
Still ridin' high behind them low beams
If you don't know about this nowhere, you don't know me
Not everybody thinks we got it made, but we do, don't we?
Yeah
But we do, don't we?

[Bridge]
Not everybody takes off their hat
Stands for the flag that them boys overseas got on their sleeve
Not everybody dies where they're born, takes a field full of corn
And turns it into whiskey, say it with me
Yeah, we do, don't we?

[Chorus]
Not everybody got that spot out in the forty
Some ten-point buck they shot, hangin' like a velvet trophy
Fridays in parkin' lots outside of somewhere holy
Not everybody likes this kind of life, but we do, don't we?
Still workin' hard like my daddy told me
Still keepin' lowkey
Still ridin' high behind them low beams
If you don't know about this nowhere, you don't know me
Not everybody thinks we got it made, but we do, don't we?
Not everybody got that spot out in the forty
(But we do, don't we?)
Fridays in parkin' lots outside of somewhere holy
Not everybody likes this kind of life, but we do, don't we?
