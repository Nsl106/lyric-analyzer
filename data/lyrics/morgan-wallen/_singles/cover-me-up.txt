[Verse 1]
A heart on the run keeps a hand on a gun
Can't trust anyone
I was so sure what I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
The days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone

[Chorus]
So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

[Verse 2]
I put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
In Richmond on high
I sobered up, I swore off that stuff
Forever this time
And the old lover's sing, “I thought it'd be me
Who helped him get home”
But home was a dream, one that I'd never seen
'Til you came along

[Chorus]
So, girl, hang your dress out to dry, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide and the river runs through
And carries this house on its stones like a piece of driftwood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

[Outro]
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good
