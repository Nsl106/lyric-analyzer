[Verse 1]
A neon moon, yeah, it's gettin' late
I look at you and I ain't thinkin' straight
Yeah, horse to the water, prolly shouldn't drink
But the truth is, we both wanna taste
You ain't gotta go and hide your phone
I know that you got that shit at home
But damn, if I ever got you alone, just so you know

[Chorus]
I'd lay you down and I'd take my time
Would you let me drown in your ocean eyes?
Ain't a part of you my hands wouldn't wanna find
That's what I'd do if you were mine

[Verse 2]
We both feel it, damn right, I said it
I know that it's wrong, but I don't regret it
If you want it to happen, baby, I'm gon' let it
'Cause I swear in a second

[Chorus]
I'd lay you down and I'd take my time
Would you let me drown in your ocean eyes?
Ain't a part of you my hands wouldn't wanna find
That's what I'd do if you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
If you were mine
Yeah, if you were mine
In another life, another life
What would it be like if you were mine?

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'd lay you down and I'd take my time
Would you let me drown in your ocean eyes?
Ain't a part of you, my hands wouldn't wanna find
Yeah, that's what I'd do if you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
If you were mine
Yeah, if you were mine
If you were mine
Yeah, if you were mine
