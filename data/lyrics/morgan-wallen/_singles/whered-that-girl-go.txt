[Verse 1]
This can't be who I think it is, is it?
My eyes must be playin' damn tricks
Came a long way from a bad good riddance
Last time I saw you, girl
You were Miss F You
Miss Better Off If I Never Met You
Won't take me two minutes to forget you
Threw a drink and a bird in my face
Sayin' I was a mistake, wait

[Chorus]
Baby, where'd that girl go?
The one that said she can't take me
Slammin' that screen door closed
Swearin' up and down that she hates me
Y'all got the same eyes
Y'all got the same lips
But she'd never be all up on me like this
Baby, where'd that girl go?
Where'd that girl go?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, chances are, I'ma run back into her
Somewhere, some night, sometime soon
And if I know her, she gon' prolly act like she don't even know you
I know you just can't help it
All I'm thinkin' to myself is

[Chorus]
Baby, where'd that girl go?
The one that said she can't take me
Slammin' that screen door closed
Swearin' up and down that she hates me
Y'all got the same eyes
Y'all got the same lips
But she'd never be all up on me like this
Baby, where'd that girl go?
Where'd that girl go?

[Bridge]
Always Miss F You
Miss Better Off If I Never Met You
'Cause I know she ain't the one I'm layin' next to
She never woulda been keepin' me awake
Beggin' me to stay

[Chorus]
Baby, where'd that girl go?
The one that said she can't take me
Slammin' that screen door closed
Swearin' up and down that she hates me
Y'all got the same eyes
Y'all got the same lips
But she'd never be all up on me like this
Baby, where'd that girl go?
Where'd that girl go?

[Outro]
Where'd that girl go?
