[Verse 1]
Twenty cigarettes and I lit me one
On that redwood deck on Demonbreun
She was with her friends, left 'em standin' there
There was more than smoke in that summer air

[Chorus 1]
We burnt two while she told me 'bout her hometown
She was drinkin' Titos, said I better slow down
I was like, "Hell, no, I ain't drinkin' by myself, no"
Said she loved my accent so I kept talkin'
Reached for the pack on the table by my wallet
We tore off to light the night we had left

[Verse 2]
With thirteen cigarettes and I lit me one
With the windows cracked in my old half-ton
Singin' take me home on them country roads
So I turned off on one then next thing you know

[Chorus 2]
We had a beer bottle lookin' like an ashtray
Under that full moon she was 'bout halfway
Naked in my truck bed, so I helped her with the rest
She was sayin' my name, barely even knew it
We were both lyin', said we never do this
To the music of the wind through the woods

[Bridge]
It was probably somewhere around two
In the morning by the time we got down to

[Verse 3]
That lucky cigarette, layin' on our backs
We were out of breath, we both took a drag
Blew it in the sky, she was gone like that
One hell of a night, one hell of a pack
