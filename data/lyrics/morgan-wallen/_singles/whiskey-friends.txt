[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm always down for two beers
That ain't nothin' new here
It's usually what I do here, but not tonight
Yeah, we had a bad one
Way worse than the last one
Ain't no comin' back from this goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
Looks like I did it again, me and my stupid mouth
I dug myself into a hole in a wall and I gotta drink my way out

[Chorus]
Bartender, pour me up again
I just took a hook on my heartbreak chin
We gon' be in here all night
She ain't the only thing I'm puttin' on ice, yeah
I need a corner with the lights turned down
I can't take a good time cold beer crowd
It's just me, Jack and Jim
Won't you play a little Whitley for me and my whiskey friends?
Me and my whiskey friends

[Verse 2]
And we just need a slow song, tryna let her go song
Throw a little Jones on
Leave us alone 'til she's long gone
Got a lot of over-her work left to do that we need to get into

[Chorus]
Bartender, pour me up again
I just took a hook on my heartbreak chin
We gon' be in here all night
She ain't the only thing I'm puttin' on ice, yeah
I need a corner with the lights turned down
I can't take a good time cold beer crowd
It's just me, Jack and Jim
Won't you play a little Whitley for me and my whiskey friends?
Me and my whiskey friends
Me and my whiskey friends

[Pre-Chorus]
Looks like I did it again, me and my stupid mouth
I dug myself into a hole in a wall now I gotta drink my way out

[Chorus]
Bartender, pour me up again
I just took a hook on my heartbreak chin
We gon' be in here all night
She ain't the only thing I'm puttin' on ice, yeah
I need a corner with the lights turned down
I can't take a good time cold beer crowd
It's just me, Jack and Jim
Won't you play a little Whitley for me and my whiskey friends?
Me and my whiskey friends
Me and my whiskey friends

[Outro]
Play a little Whitley for me and my whiskey, for me and my whiskey friends
