[Verse 1]
My granddaddy ran shine in East Tennessee
I guess that's where I got my need for speed
I sell it illegal to people numbin' their pain
I'm a little crazy, but the world's insane

[Verse 2]
I keep a loaded .44 sittin' by the bed
For the jeepers and the creepers who ain't right in the head
Hope I never have to use it, but you never know these days
I'm a little crazy, but the world's insane

[Chorus]
Oh, once you get to know me
I'm a coyote in a field of wolves
Oh, I'm a red-letter rebel
But some become the devil when the moon is full
Yeah, the only thing keeping these tracks on the train
Knowin' I'm a little crazy, but the world's insane

[Verse 3]
I'm the house on the hill where the lightnin' strikes
Kids ride by scared on their Santa Claus bikes
Oh, then one goes missin', walkin' right down main
Yeah, I'm a little crazy, but the world's insane

[Chorus]
Oh, once you get to know me
I'm a coyote in a field of wolves
Oh, I'm a red-letter rebel
But some become the devil when the moon is full
Yeah, the only thing keeping these tracks on the train
Knowin' I'm a little crazy, but the world's insane

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I'm screamin' at a TV that ain't got ears
On anti-depressants and lukewarm beers
And I do it every night, but the news don't change
Guess I'm a little crazy, but the world's insane
Oh, I'm a little crazy, but the world's insane
