[Verse 1]
You say I'll never change
I'm just a-go around town with some gasoline
Just tryin' to bum a flame
Gonna burn the whole place down
And how do you explain
Ever fallin' in love with a guy like me in the first place
Then turn around, say that I'm the worst thing?

[Chorus]
I guess I'm the problem
And you're Ms. "Never Do No Wrong"
If I'm so awful
Then why'd you stick around this long?
And if it's the whiskey
Then why you keep on pullin' it off the shelf?
You hate that when you look at me, you halfway see yourself
And it got me thinkin'
If I'm the problem, well, you might be the reason

[Verse 2]
We try to go our sеparate ways
And we're back and forth likе a swingin' door
And tomorrow's like yesterday
Some days better than the night before
And you're back with me again
Then you go and tell your friends

[Chorus]
That I'm the problem
And you're Ms. "Never Do No Wrong"
If I'm so awful
Then why'd you stick around this long?
And if it's the whiskey
Then why you keep on pullin' it off the shelf?
You hate that when you look at me, you halfway see yourself
And it got me thinkin'
If I'm the problem, well, you might be the reason

[Bridge]
If I'm such a waste of breath, such a waste of time
Then why you on your way to waste another Friday night?

[Chorus]
If I'm the problem
And you're Ms. "Never Do No Wrong"
If I'm so awful
Then why'd you stick around this long?
And if it's the whiskey
Then why you keep on pullin' it off the shelf?
You hate that when you look at me, you halfway see yourself
And it got me thinkin'
If I'm the problem, well, you might be the reason
