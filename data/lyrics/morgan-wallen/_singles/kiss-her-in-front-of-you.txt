[Verse 1]
Walked out on me like it's nothin'
Swore you would never come runnin' back
Handful of nights I was strugglin'
Drownin' what you did with a fifth of Jack

[Pre-Chorus]
And girl, you moved on quick, then you changed your mind
Wanna see me tonight, yeah
I found some greener grass and some new blue eyes

[Chorus]
And I can't wait to kiss her in front of you
I can't wait to put you through the hell that you put me through
Baby, I can't wait to see the look on your pretty face
When I break your heart in two
Yeah, you know that I can't wait to kiss her in front of you
Oh, in front of you

[Verse 2]
Might be makin' out in the corner
You'll be makin' eyes from across the room
Workin' on a drink I didn't order
Wishin' it was one that I bought for you

[Pre-Chorus]
It'll tear you up, it'll take you down
Honеy, right to the ground, yeah
Seein' what you lost, seein' what I found

[Chorus]
But I can't wait to kiss her in front of you
I can't wait to put you through thе hell that you put me through
Baby, I can't wait to see the look on your pretty face
When I break your heart in two
Yeah, you know that I
Just wanna ruin your favorite spot
Act like I don't know you when we head to the parkin' lot
What the hell you thinkin' thinkin' you'd be the only one findin' somebody new?
Yeah, you know that I can't wait to kiss her in front of you
Oh
Yeah, I can't wait to kiss her in front of you
Oh

[Bridge]
I'd hate to be you, girl, hate to be that guy

[Chorus]
But I can't wait to kiss her in front of you
I can't wait to put you through the hell that you put me through
Baby, I can't wait to see the look on your pretty face
When I break your heart in two
Yeah, you know that I
Just wanna ruin your favorite spot
Act like I don't know you when we head to the parkin' lot
What the hell you thinkin' thinkin' you'd be the only one findin' somebody new?
Yeah, you know that I can't wait to kiss her in front of you
Oh
Yeah, I can't wait to kiss her in front of you
Oh
