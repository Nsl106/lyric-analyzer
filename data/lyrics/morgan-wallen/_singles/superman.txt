[Verse 1]
One day you're gonna see my mugshot
From a night when I got a little too drunk
Hear a song about a girl that I lost
From the times when I just wouldn't grow up

[Pre-Chorus]
And when you ain't a kid no more
I hope you don't think less of me
I try to hide my fallin' short
But you're gonna see

[Chorus]
Now and then, that bottle's my kryptonite
Brings a man of steel down to his knees
Don't always know my wrong from right
Sometimes I'm my own worst enemy
No, I don't always save the day
But you know for you I'll always try
I do the best I can, but Superman's
Still just a man sometimes, oh, sometimes

[Verse 2]
One day the weight of this cold world's
Gonna find it's way down onto your back
One night the wolves will get closer
And you'll be the one they're runnin' straight at

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you back down, don't you run
Stand your ground, stick to your guns
You ain't gonna dodge every punch, but
Just know you ain't the only one

[Chorus]
Now and then, that bottle's my kryptonite
Brings a man of steel down to his knees
Don't always know my wrong from right
Sometimes I'm my own worst enemy
No, I don't always save the day
But you know for you I'll always try
I do the best I can, but Superman's
Still just a man sometimes, oh, sometimes

[Bridge]
I can't stop a bullet, but I take one
I can't move a mountain, but I face one
One day we'll say, “Where'd the years go?”
But I hope I'm always your hero

[Chorus]
'Cause now and then, that bottle's my kryptonite
Brings a man of steel down to his knees
Don't always know my wrong from right
Sometimes I'm my own worst enemy
No, I don't always save the day
But you know for you I'll always try
I do the best I can, but Superman's
Still just a man sometimes, oh, sometimes
