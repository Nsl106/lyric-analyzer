[Verse 1]
He was old-school as huntin' in a flannel
Took me with him slap middle of the rut
I was tryin' to get me one for the mantle
He was tryin' to fill the Frigidaire up
We met back at his C-10 custom
He was waitin' with a doe and a beer
I said, "I coulda killed a dozen of 'em"
He said, "Hell, why ain't one here?"

[Pre-Chorus]
He told me hold the light, pulled out a buck knife
We talked about life while I held the left leg
Went from girls to God, politics and dogs
Said I'd been lost, so Uncle Joe said

[Chorus]
"If you're gonna be a friend
Be a friend like Skoal, always there in a pinch
If you're gonna love a woman, you got
To love her like a Chevy, buddy, steady like a rock
If something's on your mind, got somethin' to say
Do it like your Browning, try to shoot 'em straight
Hell, just look around ya, be Skoal, Chevy, and Browning"

[Verse 2]
Said, "That's some shit I should've told your cousin
For he got caught up in that mess
Wherever he is, I hope he knows I love him
I'd just hate to see you be next"

[Pre-Chorus]
Said, "That's enough of that," threw a back strap
On a hot black cast iron skillet with some Dale's
While I was half beer drinkin' and half clear thinkin' to myself

[Chorus]
If you're gonna be a friend
Be a friend like Skoal, always there in a pinch
If you're gonna love a woman, you got
To love her like a Chevy, buddy, steady like a rock
If something's on your mind, got somethin' to say
Do it like your Browning, try to shoot 'em straight
Hell, just look around ya, be Skoal, Chevy, and Browning

[Bridge]
Yeah, he was old-school as huntin' in a flannel
Took me with him slap middle of the rut
I was tryin' to get me one for the mantle
But I left with somethin' better in the truck

[Chorus]
If you're gonna be a friend
Be a friend like Skoal, always there in a pinch
If you're gonna love a woman, you got
To love her like a Chevy, buddy, steady like a rock
If something's on your mind, you've got somethin' to say
Do it like your Browning, try to shoot 'em straight
Hell, just look around ya, be Skoal, Chevy, and Browning

As simple as Skoal, Chevy, and Browning
