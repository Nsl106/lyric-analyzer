[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
I sat down on a barstool, like a dern fool
'Cause she walked out again
Bartender said, "I got you, yeah, 'cause I, too
Have been in your boots, my friend
Opened up back in '85
Got me over my first wife
Been stayin' busy since the first night"
It's a story old as time

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
God made the world in seven short days
He said it was good, I bet it was great
Then God made a man, and man got lonely
He said, "Please, Lord, if I could only
Have an angel to hold in my arms"
So God made a girl, His best work of art
Oh, but He didn't make no place to go when she breaks your hеart
So man made a bar

[Verse 2: Eric Church]
For some guys it's a good time, thе half price
Half dozen buckets of beer
Some say it's a cover band, that's a cover man
I know why they're here
Didn't go the way you planned it
Damn, the devil did some damage

[Chorus: Eric Church & Morgan Wallen]
So God made the world in seven short days
He said it was good, I bet it was great
Then God made a man, and man got lonely
He said, "Please, Lord, if I could only
Have an angel to hold in my arms"
So God made a girl, His best work of art
Oh, but He didn't make no place to go when she breaks your heart
So man made a bar
Yeah, man made a bar

[Bridge: Morgan Wallen]
Sometimes an angel falls too hard
Loses more than just a piece of her heart
And she needs a place to go and make a brand new start

[Chorus: Eric Church & Morgan Wallen]
God made the world in seven short days
Said it was good, I bet it was great
God made a man, man got lonely
He said, "Please, Lord, if I could only
Have an angel to hold in my arms"
So God made a girl, His best work of art
Oh, but He didn't make no place to go when she breaks your heart
So man made a bar

[Outro: Eric Church & Morgan Wallen]
Man made a bar
Yeah, man made a bar
