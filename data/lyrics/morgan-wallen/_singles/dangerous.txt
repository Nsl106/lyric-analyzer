[Verse 1]
I could see me sittin' in the back of a cop car bangin' my head on a window
I could see me slammin' that last call shot glass, losin' everything in my billfold
Ooh, ooh
That's what I do when I'm drinkin' 'bout you

[Chorus]
So, I don't wanna go downtown doin' what we used to
Twist the top off another round, hell I got enough loose screws
I’m gettin' tired of hurtin' 'bout you
Nothin' ever changes
I think I'm gonna stay right here tonight
'Cause that could be dangerous
'Cause that could be dangerous

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I could see me doin' just fine with a Daisy Duke dime but I don't see it lastin' long
I could see me orderin' too many drinks at the bar
Get the bartender pourin' 'em strong
That's what I do when I'm tryna drink you gone

[Chorus]
So, I don't wanna go downtown doin' what we used to
Twist the top off another round, hell I got enough loose screws
I’m gettin' tired of hurting 'bout you
Nothin' ever changes
I think I'm gonna stay right here tonight
'Cause that could be dangerous
'Cause that could be dangerous

[Bridge]
Yeah, 'cause you
Got somebody else that you've been foolin'
Them same tricks up your sleeve, yeah
Ooh
I'd usually be the type to be out too
But you ruined that for me, so

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go downtown doin' what we used to
Twist the top off another round, hell I got enough loose screws
I’m gettin' tired of hurting' 'bout you
Nothin' ever changes
I think I'm gonna stay right here tonight
'Cause that could be dangerous
That could be dangerous
Dangerous
That could be dangerous
