[Verse 1]
Been talkin' to a doctor, been talkin' to the Lord
Cut off a couple people, that don't hear from me no more
They say it's for the better, but is it really for the best?
They said I'd get more sleep, but I ain't gettin' any rest

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, nothing's changed, in a way it's gettin' way worse
Way worse
Ooh, don't think I'm doin' myself any favors
Favors, since I

[Chorus]
Kicked the bottle, kicked the bag
Scratched the Broadway off the map
Baby, that'd work if I was someone else
Kicked the strangers out my bed
Kicked the voices out my head
Did my best but I just can't kick myself

[Post-Chorus]
Me, myself, and I
These rambling' ways won't ever die
Lord knows that my mama tried
But I just can't kick myself

[Verse 2]
Everybody on the outside, it's easy lookin' in
Probably think I'm doin' great like, "Take a look at him
He's gone and straighted up now, he's finally walkin' lines"
I ain't lyin', I was probably doin' fine before I

[Chorus]
Kicked the bottle, kicked the bag
Scratched the Broadway off the map
Baby, that'd work if I was someone else
Kicked the strangers out my bed
Kicked the voices out my head
Did my best but I just can't kick myself

[Post-Chorus]
Me, myself, and I
These ramblin' ways won't ever die
Lord knows that my mama tried
Said, "Son, go get some help"
Huh, what I do?
Exactly what they told me to
Kick the shit that I used to use
But I just can't kick myself

[Chorus]
Kicked the bottle, kicked the bag
Scratched the Broadway off the map
Baby, that'd work if I was someone else
Kicked the strangers out my bed
Kicked the voices out my head
Did my best but I just can't kick myself

[Post-Chorus]
Me, myself, and I
These ramblin' ways won't ever die
Lord knows that my mama tried
Said, "Son, go get some help"
Huh, what I do?
Exactly what they told me to
Kick the shit that I used to use
But I just can't kick myself
