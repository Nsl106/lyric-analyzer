[Verse 1]
I've been lookin' at you from across the room
'Bout time I got my nerve
Well you might tell me "Boy hell naw"
But hell what can it hurt?
'Cause I just wanna

[Chorus]
Spin you around, and around this dance floor
Get you drunk on a love like mine
Might wind up and steal a couple kisses
Get your digits if I can find the right line
And you don't do feelin's, and baby if you're willin'
I'ma do my best to change your mind
'Cause the way you stole my heart without a sign
Girl, it oughta be a crime

[Verse 2]
Got a pretty good feelin' I'm takin' you home
Gonna love you with all I got
But before we slip out into the night
I just want one more shot
To take your hand and

[Chorus]
Spin you around, and round this dance floor
Get you drunk on a love like mine
Might wind up and steal a couple kisses
Get your digits if I can find the right line
And you don't do feelin's, and baby if you're willin'
I'ma do my best to change your mind
'Cause the way you stole my heart without a sign
Girl, it oughta be a crime

[Bridge]
I fought in some bars, broken some hearts
Ain't ever done nothin' this bad
Yeah, with one look at me you became my disease
They don't make no cure for that

[Chorus]
And I just wanna
Spin you around, and round this dance floor
Get you drunk on a love like mine
Might wind up and steal a couple kisses
Get your digits if I can find the right line
And you don't do feelin's, and baby if you're willin'
I'ma do my best to change your mind
'Cause the way you stole my heart
Yeah, the way you stole my heart
Yeah, the way you stole my heart without a sign
Girl, it oughta be a crime
I just wanna spin you around tonight
I just wanna spin you around tonight
