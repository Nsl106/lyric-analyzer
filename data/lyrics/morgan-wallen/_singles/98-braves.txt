[Verse 1]
I remember sittin' at that house, livin' room couch
Thinkin' no way them boys wouldn't win
Between them big three pitchers, Andruw and Chipper
It was gonna be hard to keep up with the Jones's
But as fate would have it, that Atlanta magic
Got put out by them damn Padres
I guess destiny ain't always meant to be
Kinda like you and me that day

[Chorus]
We got close, but close doesn't cut it
Had a good run, to end up with nothin'
But a 3x5 that you hide in a drawer
We swung for the fences and came up short
Yeah, you win some, you lose some, it ain't always home runs
And that's just the way life plays
If we were a team, and love was a game
We'd have been the '98 Braves

[Verse 2]
Had that whole town believin'
Damn, girl, I even had that talk to your dad, man to man
But just like that season
Girl, you and me didn't end with a ring on a hand

[Chorus]
We got close, but close doesn't cut it
Had a good run, to end up with nothin'
But a 3x5 that you hide in a drawer
We swung for the fences, and came up short
Yeah, you win some, you lose some, it ain't always home runs
And that's just the way life plays
If we were a team, and love was a game
We'd have been the '98 Braves
98 Braves
You win some, you lose some, it ain't always home runs
Girl, it could've gone either way
But if we were a team, and love was a game
We'd have been the '98 Braves
If we were a team, and love was a game
We'd have been the '98 Braves
'98 Braves
Oh, yeah, girl, we'd have been the '98 Braves
'98 Braves, we'd have been the '98 Braves

[Outro]
I remember sittin' at that house, livin' room couch
Thinkin' no way them boys wouldn't win
