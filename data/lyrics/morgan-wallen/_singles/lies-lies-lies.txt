[Verse 1]
I don't come down with the sun
I won't hate myself when the mornin' comes
No thoughts of your body runnin' through my head
No bottle of bourbon beside the bed, 'cause

[Verse 2]
It wasn't no thing to give you up
I never reach for you in another touch
Don't ever think about you with him
And girl, tonight I won't call again and again
Ain't nothin' but

[Chorus]
Lies, lies, lies
Look into my eyes, eyes, eyes
I'm still a fool for you
Nothin' I wouldn't do for you
Lies, lies, lies
Girl, I'm on a downhill dive
Habits and hard heartbreaks are hard to break
So, I just tell the same old lies, liеs, lies
Yeah, baby, I can try, try, try

[Bridge]
To act like I don't givе a damn, but I do
Bet you're missin' me bad as I miss you
Snowballs to a phone call
Soundin' somethin' stupid
Baby, 'cause the truth is
The ninety proof is tellin' me

[Chorus]
Lies, lies, lies
Look into my eyes, eyes, eyes
I'm still a fool for you
Nothin' I wouldn't do for you
Lies, lies, lies
Girl, I'm on a downhill dive
Habits and hard heartbreaks are hard to break
So, I just tell the same old lies, lies, lyin' to myself
Why, why, why in the hell
Do I keep sayin', "I can get you back"?
That's about as honest as sayin' that

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't come down with the Sun
I won't hate myself when the mornin' comes
Them ain't nothin' but

[Chorus]
Lies, lies, lies
Look into my eyes, eyes, eyes
I'm still a fool for you
Nothin' I wouldn't do for you
Lies, lies, lies
Girl, I'm on a downhill dive
Habits and hard heartbreaks are hard to break
So, I just tell the same old lies, lies, lies

[Outro]
Lies, lies, lies
