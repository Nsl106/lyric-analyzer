[Verse 1]
I can't remember the last time
You looked as happy as you did tonight
Your tipsy friend grabbed that bartender
Gave him her phone and pulled us over there with her
He counted to three
And, baby, I haven't seen that side of you in forever
And I hate it's the truth but, baby, you never do when we're alone together

[Chorus]
It was good to see you smile
Girl, you know it's been a while
It was good to see you smile
Even if it was just for the picture

[Verse 2]
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
But you ain't said onе since you woke up
Silly me, thinkin' wе could make it work
Can you blame me for getting my hopes up?
You know it took me right back to how it used to be
Baby, seeing us like that is still a little bittersweet

[Chorus]
But it was good to see you smile
Girl, you know it's been a while
It was good to see you smile
Even if it was just for the picture

[Bridge]
If someone were to see this, they'd think everything's alright
At least we got a pretty little moment frozen in time

[Chorus]
It was good to see you smile
Girl, you know it's been a while
It was good to see you smile
Even if it was just for the picture
Even if it was just for the picture
