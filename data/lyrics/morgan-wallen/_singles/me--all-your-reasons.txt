[Verse 1]
Smoke on my clothes, liquor on my breath
Devil on my shoulder, strangers in my bed
Pills in my pocket, ashes on the floor
These bad decisions keep on knockin' on my door
I know you think you left me all alone
I hate to say, you couldn’t be more wrong

[Chorus]
Got Copenhagen, whiskey straight
Empty bottle, promise breakin'
All the ways I let you down, down
What went around, came back 'round
The Sunday mornin' still asleep
Traded angels for my demons
I ain't lonely since your leavin'
I've got me and all your reasons

[Verse 2]
Like all the lies I ever told, that change I never did
All the times that I was cold, all that broke you couldn't fix
I know you did just what you had to do
You looked around and saw there wasn't no room for you

[Chorus]
Just Copenhagen, whiskey straight
Empty bottle, promise breakin'
All the ways I let you down, down
What went around, came back 'round
The Sunday mornin' still asleep
Traded angels for my demons
I ain't lonely since your leavin'
I've got me and all your reasons
All your reasons

[Bridge]
I know you wanna be the one for me
No wonder why you had to run from me
Hell, even I done had enough of me
Now all I got to keep me company

[Chorus]
Is some Copenhagen, whiskey straight
Empty bottle, promise breakin'
All the ways I let you down, down
What went around, came back 'round
The Sunday mornin' still asleep
Traded angels for my demons
I ain't lonely since your leavin'
I've got me and all your reasons

[Outro]
It's just me and all your reasons
All your reasons
