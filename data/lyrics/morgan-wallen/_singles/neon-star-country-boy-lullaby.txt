[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm down bad
She slammed that door and she broke my heart
That girl sure got out of town fast
She bounced so I bounced in here, tryna bounce back
Ooh, I know I probably ought to throw a couple prayers up
To the Man upstairs
Ooh, instead of watchin' this bottle that was filled up just disappear

[Chorus]
Sittin' here wishin' on a neon star
Up there hangin' from behind the bar
Hopin' there's a U-turn in your car
Don't know why I do, 'cause it never comes true
Hey baby, what's it gon' take
For my head to unhurt and my heart to unbreak?
Ridin' on the lightning in this jar
Sittin' there wishin' on a nеon star

[Verse 2]
Girl, it happens every damn timе
You pourin' on strong, and before too long
Just old number seven's on round nine
A lot of dive bar down time
Yeah, and ooh
I know I probably ought to throw a couple prayers up
To the Man upstairs
Ooh, instead of lettin' this heart stay beat down
Pullin' up this chair

[Chorus]
Sittin' here wishin' on a neon star
Up there hangin' from behind the bar
Hopin' there's a U-turn in your car
Don't know why I do, 'cause it never comes true
Hey baby, what's it gon' take
For my head to unhurt and my heart to unbreak?
Ridin' on the lightning in this jar
Sittin' there wishin' on a neon star

[Bridge]
You ain't the only one up so high
Make a little room, 'cause so am I
I need a little help gettin' sleep tonight
So I'm singin' me country boy lullaby, like

[Chorus]
Sittin' here wishin' on a neon star
Up there hangin' from behind the bar
Hopin' there's a U-turn in your car
Don't know why I do, 'cause it never comes true
Hey baby, what's it gon' take
For my head to unhurt and my heart to unbreak?
Ridin' on the lightning in this jar
Sittin' there wishin' on a neon
Sittin' here wishin' on a neon star
Up there hangin' from behind the bar
Hopin' there's a U-turn in your car
Don't know why I do, 'cause it never comes true
Hey baby, what's it gon' take
For my head to unhurt and my heart to unbreak?
Ridin' on the lightning in this jar
Sittin' there wishin' on a neon star

[Outro]
Neon star
Sittin' here wishin' on a neon star
Sittin' here wishin' on a neon star
