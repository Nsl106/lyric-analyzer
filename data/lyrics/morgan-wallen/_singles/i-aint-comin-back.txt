[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
I'm a redneck
'Cause I drink beer and I dip Skoal
Guess I'm a rambler
'Cause I can't not be on the road
Might be a lost cause
'Cause I'll be out 'til the lights are on
And I'm a gambler
I'll take the over on the underdog, huh

[Pre-Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
Girl, half of this town has got a name for me
And I can't say I don't agree, huh

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
But the night I said, "I'm leavin'," I turned into Richard Petty
Broke my heart, so I got even in my '97 Chevy
Now I'm walkin' on this water mixed with Johnnie Walker Black
There's a lot of reasons I ain't Jesus, but the main one is that I ain't comin' back
Oh no, no, I ain't comin' back

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
You call me thе devil
Then you told me whеre to go
Go throw your pebbles
I'll be somewhere gettin' stoned
Girl, it ain't my fault
Ain't no need to wait three days
I might be a lot of things
But I ain't your savin' grace

[Chorus: Post Malone & Morgan Wallen]
Yeah, the night I said, "I'm leavin'," I turned into Richard Petty
Broke my heart, so I got even in my '97 Chevy
Now I'm walkin' on this water mixed with Johnnie Walker Black
There's a lot of reasons I ain't Jesus, but the main one is that I ain't comin' back
Oh no, no, I ain't comin' back

[Bridge: Morgan Wallen]
Girl, half of this town has got a name for me
But there's one I'll never be, no

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen, Morgan Wallen & Post Malone]
'Cause the night I said, "I'm leavin'," I turned into Richard Petty
Broke my heart and I got even in my '97 Chevy
Now I'm walkin' on this water, mixed with Johnnie Walker Black
There's a lot of reasons I ain't Jesus, but the main one is that I ain't comin' back
Oh no, no, I ain't comin' back

[Outro: Morgan Wallen]
Oh
