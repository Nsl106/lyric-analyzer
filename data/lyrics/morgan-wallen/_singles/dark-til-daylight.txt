[Verse 1]
When I'm sittin' here alone
Gettin' drunk and gettin' stoned, I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Been a hard wall to climb
Swear to God, I'm doin' time here without you

[Pre-Chorus]
Sun's sinkin' low, here we go
Another shadow to fight through
That's what I do
The whole damn night through

[Chorus]
(Ooh)
It's sinkin' in what coulda been
I'm with her, you're with him, and that ain't right
(Ooh)
The sunset is when it starts
Sky ain't all that's gettin' dark 'til daylight
I'm strung out, I'm a mess
Words and whiskey on my breath
See how faded I can get by sunrise
(Ooh)
Yeah, I'm fallin' apart
Sky ain't all that's gettin' dark 'til daylight

[Verse 2]
I'm sinkin' up, but comin' down
That's a sure way to drown, it's what I'm used to
A touch that's cut you deep
It's hard to find, it's hard to keep, it's hard to lose, too

[Pre-Chorus]
Another smoke, another flame
Another rush to the brain, but it ain't you
That's what I do
The whole damn night through

[Chorus]
(Ooh)
It's sinkin' in what coulda been
I'm with hеr, you're with him, and that ain't right
(Ooh)
The sunset is whеn it starts
Sky ain't all that's gettin' dark 'til daylight
I'm strung out, I'm a mess
Words and whiskey on my breath
See how faded I can get by sunrise
(Ooh)
And yeah, I'm fallin' apart
Sky ain't all that's gettin' dark 'til daylight

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Sun's sinkin' low, here we go
Another shadow to fight through
That's what I do
The whole damn night through

[Chorus]
(Ooh)
It's sinkin' in what coulda been
I'm with her, you're with him, and that ain't right
(Ooh)
The sunset is when it starts
Sky ain't all that's gettin' dark 'til daylight
I'm strung out, I'm a mess
Words and whiskey on my breath
See how faded I can get by sunrise
(Ooh)
Yeah, I'm fallin' apart
Sky ain't all that's gettin' dark 'til daylight
(Ooh)
It's sickenin' what coulda been
I'm with her, you're with him, and that ain't right
(Ooh)
The sunset is when it starts
Sky ain't all that's gettin' dark 'til daylight
