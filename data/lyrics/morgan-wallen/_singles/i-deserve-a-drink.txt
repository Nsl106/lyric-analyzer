[Verse 1]
I been doin' good, so good
I been on my best behavior
I been livin' by the book
I should've known that sooner or later
You'd walk in this place and I'd break
Take two steps back and say
"What's one little taste gonna hurt?"

[Chorus]
You're burnin' hotter than a bourbon with no water
And I want your buzz in my veins
Girl, in the mornin' you'll walk out the door, and
I'll pour us back down the sink
But tonight I deserve a drink

[Verse 2]
What am I supposed to do? Girl, I always lose to your temptation
You're another shot that I shouldn't knock back but damn, baby
You're layin' it on, you're leanin' it in
Yeah, I've been keepin' it strong for so long
But I need it again, yeah, I need you again

[Chorus]
'Cause you're burnin' hotter than a bourbon with no water
And I want your buzz in my veins
Girl, in the mornin' you'll walk out the door, and
I'll pour us back down the sink
But tonight I dеserve a drink
I desеrve a drink

[Bridge]
I been doin' good, so good
I been on my best behavior

[Chorus]
You're burnin' hotter than a bourbon with no water
And I want your buzz in my veins
Girl, in the mornin' you'll walk out the door, and
I'll pour us back down the sink
But tonight your eyes are tellin' me things
Like I, I deserve a drink
I deserve a drink
