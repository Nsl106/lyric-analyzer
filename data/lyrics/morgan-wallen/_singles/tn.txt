[Verse 1]
It's the liquor in my cup, it's the tag on my truck
And the tag on the buck that I dropped Thanksgiving last season
TN
It's the letters on my hat, it's the dust on my dash
When I take my last breath, that's the dirt that they gonna bury me in
TN

[Chorus]
It still got the JD in a Dixie, and the UT on the TV
And that smokey mountain smoke I'm breathin'
But I'd bet my last Rocky Top Dollar, that she's in
In CO, or CA or back home in GA
Any place she won't see me in
Now the one thing I was needin'
Is the only damn thing I couldn't keep in TN

[Verse 2]
It's that I-40 ride we took all the time
She took that night when I couldn't talk her out of leavin'
TN
There ain't еnough sad songs down in Nashville
Ain't enough moonshine up in thеm hills
To give her a good reason to come on back to me in TN

[Chorus]
It still got the JD in a Dixie, and the UT on the TV
And that smokey mountain smoke I'm breathin'
But I'd bet my last Rocky Top Dollar, that she's in
In CO, or CA or back home in GA
Any place she won't see me in
Now the one thing I was needin'
Is the only damn thing I couldn't keep in TN

[Bridge]
It's the number she ain't gonna pick up
I would've gone with her, but I couldn't give up
I couldn't give up

[Chorus]
All the JD in a Dixie, or the UT on the TV
And that smokey mountain smoke I'm breathin'
But I'd bet my last Rocky Top Dollar, that she's in
In CO, or CA or back home in GA
Any place she won't see me in
Now the one thing I was needin'
Is the only damn thing I couldn't keep in TN
