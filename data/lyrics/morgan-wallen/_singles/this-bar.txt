[Chorus]
I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin’ new friends
I was growin' up and nothin' made sense
Buzzin’ all night like neon in the dark
I found myself in this

[Verse 1]
Couldn't wait to turn twenty-one
The day I did, I got too drunk
Spinnin' round dizzy on the patio
Found out real quick how to take it slow
Got whiskey bent on whiskey sours
Ran my mouth to an out-of-towner
Learned a big lesson when I met the bouncer

[Chorus]
I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin' new friends
I was growin' up and nothin' made sense
Buzzin' all night like neon in the dark
I found myself in this bar

[Post Chorus]
Oh, woah
Oh, woah
Oh, woah
I found myself in this

[Verse 2]
Saw her in the corner sippin’ somethin’ tall
Cracked a few jokes, we hit it off
Year down the road, I'm watchin’ her
Walk through the door with some new jerk
And we had it good, and it hurt so bad
But I had to stand my ground
Chase my pride with another round

[Chorus]
I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin' new friends
I was growin' up and nothin’ made sense
Learnin' how to live with a broken heart
I found myself in this bar

[Post Chorus]
Oh, woah
Oh, woah
Oh, woah

[Bridge]
Those nights, what I would give for one more
Bud Lights and kissin' on the front porch
Didn't even know what I was lookin' for

[Outro]
But I found myself in this bar
I found myself in this bar
I found myself in this bar
Ain't it strange the things you keep tucked in your heart?
I found myself in this bar
