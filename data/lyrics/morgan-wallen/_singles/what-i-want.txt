[Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
She said, "You don't want this heart, boy, it's already broke"
Told me everything she touch just goes up in smoke
Only stay a couple nights, then she gon' be gone
I said, "Baby, you should know that's what I want"

[Post-Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
That's what I want, that's what I want
That's what I want, that's what I want, that's what I want
What I want

[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
Nah, you ain't gotta worry 'bout no trust issues with me
I got 'em too, I got 'em too
Nah, you ain't gotta worry 'bout no exes that's crazy
I got 'em too, you know I do

[Pre-Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
If you're in a hurry
Nah, you ain't gonna hurt me tonight
And it won't be the worst thing
If this is all it is, and in the middle of a kiss

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Tate McRae, Morgan Wallen]
She said, "You don't want this heart, boy, it's already broke"
Told me everything she touch just goes up in smoke
Only stay a couple nights, then she gon' be gone
I said, "Baby, you should know that's what I want"

[Post-Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Tate McRae, Morgan Wallen, Tate McRae]
That's what I want, that's what I want (That's what I want)
That's what I want, that's what I want, that's what I want (That's what I want)
That's what I want (Oh)

[Verse 2: Tate McRae]
There are no hard feelings if you only wanna act like lovers do
For a night or two (Oh, oh yeah)
And sometimes in the mornin', go back to bein' someone you never knew (Hey, yeah)
You never knew

[Pre-Chorus: Tate McRae, Morgan Wallen & Tate McRae, Morgan Wallen]
Baby, don't you worry
You ain't gonna hurt me tonight
It won't be the worst thing
If this is how it is (I said), then he (She) kissed me again

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Tate McRae, Tate McRae, Morgan Wallen]
And said, "You don't want this heart, boy, it's already broke"
Told me everything she touch just goes up in smoke
Only stay a couple nights then she gon' be gone
I said, "Baby, you should know that's what I want" (What I want)
She said, "You don't want this heart, no, it can't be fixed" (Ah, yeah)
And I ain't ready to try on a night like this
But if you still wanna stay, there ain't nothin' wrong (No, there's nothin' wrong)
I said, "Baby, you should know that's what I want"

[Post-Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Tate McRae, Morgan Wallen, Tate McRae]
That's what I want, that's what I want
That's what I want, that's what I want, that's what I want (Ooh)
That's what I want, hey, yeah, yeah, oh
That's what I want, that's what I want, that's what I want (Ooh; Mm, yeah)
That's what I want (Hey, yeah, uh)

[Outro: Tate McRae]
That's what I want, that's what I want
