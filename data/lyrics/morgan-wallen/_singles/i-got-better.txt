[Verse 1]
Everything's still pretty much the same 'round here
Neighbors still shootin' all of next year's deer
Boys still lose 'less they're playin' at home
But I got better since you got gone
I'm still a few too many on a Friday night
I still try to step in when it ain't my fight
I'm still me, don't get me wrong
But I got better since you got gone

[Chorus]
Swear it was like, "I'll be damned"
I'm finally back to bein' who I am
When we were over, it was overnight
Light came on, it all felt right, when it all went wrong
You turned me loose
Wasn't no tellin' who I'd turn into
But it turns out me and you together's why it took so long
'Cause I got better since you got gone

[Verse 2]
For a little while there, you had me convinced
That my mama was the devil, now we're talkin' again
My friends you hated ain't said one word
Besides, "You got better since you lost her"

[Chorus]
Swear it was like, "I'll be damned"
I'm finally back to bein' who I am
When we were over, it was overnight
Light came on, it all felt right, when it all went wrong
You turned me loose
Wasn't no tellin' who I'd turn into
But it turns out me and you together's why it took so long
'Cause I got better since you got gone
Oh, baby, since you got gone

[Bridge]
And I ain't sayin' you're the sleep that I lost
But I never slept this good before
I ain't sayin' you're the weight on my back
I'm just sayin' that it ain't there no more

[Chorus]
I'll be damned
I'm finally back to bein' who I am
When we were over, it was overnight
Light came on, it all felt right, when it all went wrong
You turned me loose
Wasn't no tellin' who I'd turn into
But it turns out me and you together's why it took so long
'Cause I got better since you got gone
Yeah, baby, since you got gone
