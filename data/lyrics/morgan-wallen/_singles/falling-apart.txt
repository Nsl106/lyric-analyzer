[Verse 1]
I've been sleeping on the couch
If you wanna call it sleep
Every square inch of this house
Is messy as you left me
Between the sour mash and the barley
And all the bottles in the trash
You'd think I'm a living party
But, girl, you're the life of that

[Pre-Chorus]
Turns out I needed you
And leavin' you
Wasn't half as smart as I thought it was
'Cause my life's in pieces now
And I'm seein' how
What we had was 'bout as good as it comes

[Chorus]
And now I know better
'Cause without your arms
To hold me together
Baby, I'm fallin' apart
Baby, I'm fallin' apart

[Verse 2]
Sold us out to buy my freedom
And, baby, now I'm paying the price
I swore I had a list of reasons
But that's a list that I can't find
If I'd have built my life around you
I coulda built it to the sky
Swore that I could live without you
But I'd die to havе you back tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Turns out I needed you
And leavin' you
Wasn't half as smart as I thought it was
'Cause my lifе's in pieces now
And I'm seein' how
What we had was 'bout as good as it comes

[Chorus]
But now I know better
'Cause without your arms
To hold me together
Baby, I'm fallin' apart
Baby, I'm fallin' apart

[Post-Chorus]
I guess I signed up for the crashin' down
I'm just waitin' on the rest to happen now

[Pre-Chorus]
Turns out I needed you
And leavin' you
Wasn't half as smart as I thought it was
'Cause my life's in pieces now
And I'm seein' how
What we had was 'bout as good as it comes

[Chorus]
Now I know better
'Cause without your arms
To hold me together
Baby, I'm fallin' apart
Baby, I'm fallin' apart

[Post-Chorus]
I guess I signed up for the crashin' down
I'm just waitin' on the rest to happen now
