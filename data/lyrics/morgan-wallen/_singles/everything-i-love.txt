[Verse 1]
I wish I woulda met you anywhere but where I did
Some old high-rise town that I won't ever go again
I wish we woulda rolled around in some old cab and chased them city lights
And hit bars I don't like

[Pre-Chorus]
We were listenin' to "one more silver dollar"
Hangin' out my Silverado down a road I love to ride

[Chorus]
Wish I woulda known that by now you'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us in a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love

[Verse 2]
I don't care how much they're bitin', I won't even crank the boat
Soon as that bobber hits thе water, girl, your memory starts to float
Baby, why'd l evеr take the bait and take you places that I love to go?
Hell, I'll never know

[Pre-Chorus]
I even took you to my hometown to meet my mama
Now I'm gonna see you every time I see that welcome sign

[Chorus]
Wish I woulda known that by now you'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us in a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna hear "one more silver dollar"
I can't take my Silverado down them roads we used to ride

[Chorus]
Wish I woulda known that by now you'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us in a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
I can't go nowhere near the whiskey 'cause you used to drink it with me
In the bed of my truck and now I can't get drunk
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
