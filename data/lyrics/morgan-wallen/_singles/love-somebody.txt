[Verse 1]
Rumors goin' all over town
Can't keep my name out they mouth these days
Yeah, they say
I live too fast to settle down
Truth is I just ain't about these games
They all play

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna find
Somethin' stronger than the whiskey
And oh, I've tried
But every time I feel her kiss me, I keep comin' up empty, yeah

[Chorus]
I just wanna love somebody
Who won't leave a hole in my heart
I just wanna love somebody
That don't want me fallin' apart
And I'd be lucky if I ever find
A somethin' more than just a crazy night
I just wanna love somе-

[Verse 2]
​-Body who ain't hypnotized
By dollar signs and blindin' lights
Like they tеnd to be, yeah
I need someone that I'd be proud
To take on back to my hometown
Honest eyes that just ain't gonna lead

[Pre-Chorus]
To lonely nights
Even when she's up against me
I don't know why
It feels like there's nobody with me
And I'm still empty, yeah

[Chorus]
I just wanna love somebody
Who won't leave a hole in my heart
I just wanna love somebody
That don't want me fallin' apart
And I'd be lucky if I ever find
A somethin' more than just a crazy night
I just wanna love somebody

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I just wanna love somebody (Woah)
I just wanna love somebody
Who won't leave a hole in my heart
I just wanna love somebody
That don't want me fallin' apart
And I'd be lucky if I ever find
A somethin' more than just a crazy night
I just wanna love somebody
