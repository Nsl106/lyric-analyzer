[Verse 1]
When the tears get to fallin', do you miss my shoulder?
When the nights get cold, do you still reach over?
Do you dodge everywhere, everythin' that reminds you
Or do you point your wheels down memory lane like I do?

[Chorus]
When you're crawlin' into bed with the guy you chose
Instead of spendin' Saturday night alone
Tell me, am I still where your mind'll go?
Who do you see when your eyes are closed?
'Cause baby, I can tell ya, it's you for me
No one else can do the things you do for me
Can you feel me in the air, baby, like a ghost?
Who do you see when your eyes are closed?

[Verse 2]
Do you dream on back to our up-all-nighters?
When my smart-ass mouth made the world feel lighter
When you said we were done, did you really mean maybe?
Or am I the only one, am I just plain crazy, baby?

[Chorus]
When you're crawlin' into bed with the guy you chose
Instead of spendin' Saturday night alone
Tell me, am I still where your mind'll go?
Who do you see when your eyes are closed?
'Cause baby, I can tell ya, it's you for me
No one else can do the things you do for me
Can you feel me in the air, baby, like a ghost?
Who do you see when your eyes are closed?
Who do you see when your eyes are closed?

[Bridge]
'Cause I can't get you outta my brain these days
Even for a night
I can feel you here, can you feel me there?
Now and then, or every time?

[Chorus]
When you're crawlin' into bed with the guy you chose
Instead of spendin' Saturday night alone
Tell me, am I still where your mind'll go?
Who do you see when your eyes are closed?
'Cause baby, I can tell ya, it's you for me
No one else can do the things you do for me
Can you feel me in the air, baby, like a ghost?
Who do you see when your eyes are closed?
Who do you see when your eyes are closed?
Who do you see when your eyes are closed?
