Well it was Newyears eve I was fourteen at the time
I was celabration 4:am with them hoodlum friends of mine
I heard a boy named Elvis Presely singing that all right Mama on the radio
And it turned me on
I been Hooked on Music Hooked on music from that moment on. heh heh heh

All my friends thought I had one brick less than a load
Cause I'd stop the car and I jump out and start dancing in the road
When I heard Jerry Lee Lewis Singing Whole lot of shaking going on
And it turned me on
I been Hooked on Music Hooked on music from that moment on. heh heh heh

I'm stealing fancy hubcaps off them coyboys' pickup trucks
Fender skirts and mud flaps anything to make a buck
I'll sell'em right back to em out behind the rodeo
Just to make a little money to take my little honey to a rock and roll show

Well I hung around that skating rink where buddy Holly played
I could not believe one man could have such fun and still get payed
When I heard the local DJ playing, That 'll be the Day
It turned me on, said turned me on
I been Hooked on Music Hooked on music from that moment on. heh heh heh
All give me some………………

Well I finially got some tickets to see Elvis Live and hot
My girl friend almost jumped my bones going back to the parking lot
I knew that it was not my great physique, good looks and charm...
That left that texas teenybopper's nailprints in my arm

So I bought myself a guitar and I wrote me a lady's song
But I'd change the Name to fit my latest flame
And that sucker never came out wrong
I'd sit back and sing it soft and low
Watch'm as it slowly turned them, on I'd turn 'em on
I been Hooked on Music Hooked on music from that moment on. heh heh heh

Do de de do de de do de de hooked on music
Hooked on music
