What would you say if I told you
I've always wanted to hold you
I don't know what we're afraid of
Nothing would change if we made love

So I'll be your friend and I'll be your lover
'Cause I know in our hearts we agree
We can be both to each other
Oh yes, we can be both to each other

I know the chances we're taking
And somebody's heart could be breaking
Still we can't stop what's inside us
Our love for each other will guide us

And I'll be your friend and I'll be your lover
'Cause I know in our hearts we agree
We can be both to each other

I've been through you and you've been through me
And sometimes a friend is the hardest to see
We always know when it's laid on the line
Nobody else is as easy to find

And I'll be your friend and I'll be your lover
'Cause I know in our hearts we agree
We can be both to each other
Oh yes, we can be both to each other
