Oh, well I'm the type of guy who will never settle down
Where pretty girls are, well, you know that I'm around
I kiss em and I love em cause to me they're all the same
I hug em and I squeeze em they don't even know my name
They call me the wanderer, yeah the wanderer
I roam around, around, around, around

Oh, well, there's Flo on my left arm and there's Mary on my right
And Janie is the girl, well that I'll be with tonight
And when she asks me which one I love the best
I'll tear open my shirt and I show her Rosie on my chest
Cause I'm the wanderer, yeah the wanderer
I roam around, around, around, around

Oh, well I roam from town to town
I go through life without a care
And I'm as happy as a clown
With my two fists on iron but I'm going no where

Oh yeah, I'm the type of guy that likes to roan around
I'm never in one place; I roam from town to town
And when I find myself falling for some girl
I hop right into that car of mine and drive around the world
Yeah, I'm the wanderer, yeah the wanderer

I roam around, around, around, around
