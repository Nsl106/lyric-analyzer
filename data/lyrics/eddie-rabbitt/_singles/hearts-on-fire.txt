[Verse 1]
We shouldn't be together tonight, but here we are
I shouldn't taste the thrill of your kiss here in the dark
'Cause we're not free to be this free or go this far

[Chorus]
Hearts on fire, burning for each other
Going down in flames somewhere in the night
Stealing love again when we're together
It's too late now, we can't put it out hearts on fire

[Verse 2]
You shouldn't feel this good in my arms, but you do
I shouldn't whisper these things in your ear, but they're true
So wrong or right, I'll stay tonight with you

[Chorus]
Hearts on fire, burning for each other
Going down in flames somewhere in the night
Stealing love again when we're together
It's too late now, we can't put it out hearts on fire
