I came in here to have a good time
With nothing particular on my mind
When I saw you sitting there by yourself
Why don’t we put a nickel in the old jukebox?
Yeah, come on baby, I’ll dance off your socks
Cause you sure look like you need a friend tonight

I wanna dance with you, be with you
Maybe you could show me a thing or two
I wanna dance with you, talk with you
Maybe together we can shake the blues
I wanna dance with you, rock with you
We’ll have a ball before the night is through
I wanna dance with you
I wanna dance with you
I wanna dance with you-woo-woo-woo-woo

I don’t even know your name yet
But you’re the kind of girl a man can’t forget
The way you move sure sets my soul on fire
So come on baby we’ll show ‘em all
We’ll dance on the ceiling, we’ll dance on the wall
Before you’re through, dance into this heart of mine, mine, mine

I wanna dance with you, be with you
Maybe you could show me a thing or two
I wanna dance with you, and talk with you
Maybe together we can shake the blues
I wanna dance with you, rock with you
We’ll have a ball before the night is through
I wanna dance with you
I wanna dance with you
I wanna dance with you-woo-woo-woo-woo
Yeah

So come on baby we’ll show ‘em all
We’ll dance on the ceiling, we’ll dance on the wall
Before you’re through, dance into this heart of mine, mine, mine, mine, mine

I wanna dance with you, be with you
Maybe you could show me a thing or two
I wanna dance with you, talk with you
Maybe together we can shake the blues
I wanna dance with you, rock with you
We’ll have a ball before the night is through
I wanna dance with you
I wanna dance with you
I said I wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna dance with you-woo-woo-woo-woo
Woo-woo-woo-woo
Can’t you hear me little darling?
