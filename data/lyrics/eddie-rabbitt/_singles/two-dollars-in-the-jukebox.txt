I've got two dollars in the jukebox
And five dollars in a bottle
And ten more
Just in case that don't do the trick

And I'll be dead broke tomorrow morning
With heartaches by the dozen
And a lady on my mind
That's driving me crazy

Why do I
Why do I
Need to see those blue eyes
Looking at me that way again?
After the way she did me
It's a sin

How could she
How could she
Just walk out and leave me?
After all these nights in her arms
Look where I am

And I've got two dollars in the jukebox
And five dollars in a bottle
And ten more
Just in case that don't do the trick

And I'll be dead broke tomorrow morning
With heartaches by the dozen
And a lady on my mind
That's driving me crazy

I've got two dollars in the jukebox
And five dollars in a bottle
And ten more
Just in case that don't do the trick

And I'll be dead broke tomorrow morning
With heartaches by the dozen
And a lady on my mind
That's driving me crazy
I've got a lady on my mind
That's driving me crazy
