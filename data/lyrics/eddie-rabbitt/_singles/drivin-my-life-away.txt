[Verse 1]
Well, the midnight headlight blind you on a rainy night
Steep grade up ahead, slow me down, makin' no time
But I gotta keep rollin'
Those windshield wipers slappin' out a tempo
Keepin' perfect rhythm with the song on the radio
But I gotta keep rollin'

[Chorus]
Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a better way for me
Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a sunny day

[Verse 2]
Well, the truck stop cutie comin' on to me
Tried to talk me into a ride, said I wouldn't be sorry
But she was just a baby
Hey, waitress, pour me another cup of coffee
Pop it down, jack me up, shoot me out, flyin' down the highway
Lookin' for the mornin'

[Chorus]
Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a better way for me
Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a sunny day

[Verse 1]
Well, the midnight headlight blind you on a rainy night
Steep grade up ahead, slow me down, makin' no time
But I gotta keep rollin'
Those windshield wipers slappin' out a tempo
Keepin' perfect rhythm with the song on the radio
But I gotta keep rollin'

[Chorus]
Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a better way for me
Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a sunny day
Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a better way for me
Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a sunny day, yeah
Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a better way for me
