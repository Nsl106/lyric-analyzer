[Verse 1]
It'd be a lie to say I'm not gonna miss you
So please don't say goodbye now
'Til I've kissed you one more time
And held you as I did when you were mine

[Verse 2]
It'd be a lie to say I don't still love you
I won't be thinking of you, girl
I'll never try to call you one more time
Or try to find a way to change your mind

[Chorus]
Ooh, you don't love me anymore
Oh baby, you don't love me anymore
Baby, please forgive me but the wine's gone to my head
And tomorrow I'll remember how you turned to me and said

[Verse 3]
It'd be a lie to say that I still love you
That I'll be thinking of you, boy
I'll drive by to say hello sometime
Oh, but now you're gone and all I have are five words on my mind

[Chorus]
Ooh, you don't love me anymore
Oh baby, you don't love me anymore
Baby, please forgive me but the wine's gone to my head
And tomorrow I'll remember how you turned to me and said

[Outro]
Ooh, you don't love me anymore
Oh, baby
You don't love me anymore
I'll have to face it
You don't love me anymore
Oh, baby
You don't love me anymore
Honey, it hurts so bad
'Cause you don't love me anymore
Oh, baby
You don't love me anymore
Tears are falling
'Cause you don't love me anymore
Oh, baby
You don't love me anymore
