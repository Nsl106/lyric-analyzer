[Verse 1]
I've seen the storm clouds in your past
But rest assured 'cause you are safe at home at last
I rescued you, you rescued me
And we're right where we should be when we're together

[Verse 2]
I know the questions in your mind
But go ahead and ask me one more time
You'll find the answer's still the same
It won't change from day to day, for worse or better

[Chorus]
Will I promise to be your best friend?
And am I here until the end?
Can I be sure I have been waiting for you?
And did I say my love is true?
Baby, I will, I am, I can, I have, I do

[Verse 3]
I know the time will disappear
But this love we're building on will always be here
No way that this is sinking sand
On this solid rock we'll stand forever

[Chorus]
Will I promise to be your best friend?
And am I here until the end?
Can I be sure I have been waiting for you?
And did I say my love is true?
Baby, I will, I am, I can, I have, I do

[Outro]
Baby, I will, I am, I can, I have
Oh, I will, I am, I can, I have
Baby, I will, I am, I can, I have, I do
