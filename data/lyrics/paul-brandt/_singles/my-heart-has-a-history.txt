[Chorus]
My heart has a history
Of hurtin' those who mean the most to me
Before you get too close to me
I think you oughta know
While other hearts are holdin' on
While other loves are growin' strong
My heart has a history of lettin' go

[Verse 1]
The first time I looked into your eyes
I knew this moment would arrive
I got a feelin' you're the one
But my heart keeps tryin' to turn and run
The problem is this happens every time

[Chorus]
My heart has a history
Of hurtin' those who mean the most to me
Before you get too close to me
I think you oughta know
While other hearts are holdin' on
While other loves are growin' strong
My heart has a history of lettin' go

[Verse 2]
If we can take this one kiss at a time
Maybe we can tame this heart of mine
I'm telling you the cold, hard truth
I ain't ever been loved by the likes of you
And I ain't ever had this much on the line

[Chorus]
But my heart has a history
Of hurtin' those who mean the most to me
Before you get too close to me
I think you oughta know
While other hearts are holdin' on
While other loves are growin' strong
My heart has a history of lettin' go
Yeah, my heart has a history of lettin' go
