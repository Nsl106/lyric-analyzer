[Verse 1]
She's waiting for someone
Who could turn her life around
But someone who could make her feel
The way she used to feel
But he never comes

[Verse 2]
She's dating, but no one
That she cares to talk about
And all the flowers in the world
Don't amount to much
When what she wants is love

[Chorus]
And she'd give anything and everything to fall in love
Just this one time, she'd like to find
What she's been dreaming of
She could find someone to hold her
But that wouldn't be enough
She'd give anything to fall in love

[Verse 2]
Now she's looking just like
She'd rather be someplace else
Staring across the bar, lost in herself
Will he ever come?

[Chorus]
Cause she'd give anything and everything to fall in love
Just this one time, she'd like to find
What she's been dreaming of
She could find someone to hold her
But that wouldn't be enough
She'd give anything to fall in love

[Bridge]
She's gonna keep on making wishes
She's gonna keep on being strong
She won't settle for less than true love
She's gonna keep on holding on

[Chorus]
She'd give anything and everything to fall in love
Just this one time, she'd like to find
What she's been dreaming of
She could find someone to hold her
But that wouldn't be enough
She'd give anything to fall in love

[Tag]
She'd give anything to fall in love
In love, oh
