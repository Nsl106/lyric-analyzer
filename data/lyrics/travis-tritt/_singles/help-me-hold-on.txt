[Verse 1]
Baby, close that suitcase you've been packin'
Just sit down and talk to me a while
I know you tried to tell me what was lackin'
But I guess I must have missed it by a mile

[Verse 2]
Well, this time girl I swear to you I'll listen
Help me understand where I went wrong
It's hard to find myself in this position
Scared that I'll go crazy once you're gone

[Chorus]
Help me hold on to what we had
Once our love was strong, it can be again
You said it takes two to make love last
You were right all along, so help me hold on

[Verse 3]
What have I got to do to make it better?
What have I got to do to make you see?
That even though I promised you forever
I never knew how hard that would be

[Verse 4]
I realize I took your love for granted
But I've learned that love worth havin' don't come free
And I'll pay any price it takes to keep you
Satisfied and stayin' here with me

[Chorus]
Help me hold on to what we had
Once our love was strong, it can be again
You said it takes two to make love last
You were right all along, so help me hold on

[Guitar Solo]
Help me hold on to what we had
Once our love was strong, it can be again
You said it takes two to make love last
You were right all along, so help me hold on

[Intro]
You were right all along, so help me hold on
