[Verse 1]
I can't hide the way I feel about you
Anymore
I can't hold the hurt inside, keep the pain out of my eyes
Anymore

[Chorus]
My tears no longer waiting
My resistance ain't that strong
My mind keeps recreating
A life with you alone
And I'm tired of pretending
I don't love you anymore

[Verse 2]
Let me make one last appeal to show you how I feel
About you (Mhm)
'Cause there's no one else, I swear, holds a candle anywhere
Next to you (Mmm-hmm)

[Chorus]
My heart can't take the beating
Not havin' you to hold
A small voice keeps repeating
Deep inside my soul
It says I can't keep pretending
I don't love you anymore

[Bridge]
I've got to take the chance or let it pass by
If I expect to get on with my life

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
My tears no longer waiting
Oh, my resistance ain't that strong
But my mind keeps recreating
A life with you alone
And I'm tired of pretending
I don't love you anymore

[Outro]
Anymore
Anymore
