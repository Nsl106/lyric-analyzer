[Verse 1]
When I woke up this mornin'
Wiped the sleep from my eyes
I found a new day dawning
And suddenly I realized
You're gone

[Chorus]
Tell me I was dreamin'
That you didn't leave me here to cry
You didn't say you don't love me anymore
It was just my imagination tellin' lies
Tell me that you didn't say goodbye

[Verse 2]
I'm in a state of confusion
I hope things aren't what they seem
If this is really happening
Just let me go back to dream
You're home

[Chorus]
Tell me I was dreamin'
That you didn't leave me here to cry
You didn't say you don't love me anymore
It was just my imagination tellin' lies
Tell me that you didn't say goodbye

[Guitar Solo]
Oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Tell me I was dreamin' (tell me I was dreamin')
That you didn't leave me here to cry
You didn't say you don't love me anymore
It was just my imagination tellin' lies
Oh, oh-oh, tell me that you didn't say goodbye

[Outro]
Darlin', tell me you didn't say goodbye

[Guitar Solo]
