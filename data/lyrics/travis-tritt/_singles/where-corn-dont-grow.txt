[Verse 1]
As we sat on the front porch of that old grey house where I was born and raised
Starin' at the dusty fields where my daddy worked hard every day
I think it kinda hurt him when I said, "Daddy there's a lot that I don't know
But don't you ever dream about a life where corn don't grow?"

[Verse 2]
He just sat there silent, starin' at his favorite coffee cup
I saw a storm of mixed emotion in his eyes when he looked up
He said, "Son, I know at your age it seems like this ole world is turnin' slow
And you think you'll find the answer to it all where corn don't grow"

[Chorus]
Hard times are real
There's dusty fields no matter where you go
But you may change your mind
'Cause the weeds are high where corn don't grow

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I remember feelin' guilty when daddy turned and walked back in the house
I was only seventeen back then but I thought that I knew more than I know now
I can't say he didn't warn me, this city life's a hard row to hoe
Ain't it funny how a dream can turn around where corn don't grow?

[Chorus]
Hard times are real
There's dusty fields no matter where you go
And you may change your mind
'Cause the weeds are high where corn don't grow
You may change your mind
Oh, the weeds are high where corn don't grow
