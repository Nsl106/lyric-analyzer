[Chorus]
Well, it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a redhead ridin' shotgun
And a pistol by my side
Tearin' down that highway
Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde

[Verse 1]
We met at a truck stop
Johnson City, Tennessee
I was gassin' up my Firebird
When I heard her callin' me
Said, "Which way are you headed, boy?
Do you need some company?"

[Verse 2]
She had me stoppin' at a quick mart
Before we made it outta town
Next thing, she was runnin' at me
Tellin' me to lay that hammer down
'Cause there's a man right behind me
Doin' his best to slow me down

[Chorus]
Yeah, and it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a redhead ridin' shotgun
And a pistol by my side, mm-mm
Tearin' down that highway
Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde

[Bridge]
Well, we pulled up to a motel
In the middle of the night
We were countin' all the money
Smokin' stolen Marlboro lights
Lord, we never saw 'em comin'
'Til they read us both our rights

[Chorus]
Yeah, and it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a sheriff right beside me
Pistol pointed at my side, woah, Lord
Such a disappointing ending
For this modern day Bonnie and Clyde

[Outro]
Yeah, oh
Woah
Yeah
Ooh-ooh
Yeah
