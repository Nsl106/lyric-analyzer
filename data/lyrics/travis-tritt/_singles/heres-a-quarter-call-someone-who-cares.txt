[Verse 1]
You say you were wrong to ever leave me alone
And now you're sorry, you're lonesome and scared
And you say you'd be happy if you could just come back home
Well, here's a quarter, call someone who cares

[Chorus]
Call someone who'll listen, and might give a damn
Maybe one of your sordid affairs
But don't you come around here handin' me none of your lies
Here's a quarter, call someone who cares

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Girl, I thought what we had could never turn bad
So your leavin' caught me unaware
But the fact is you've run, girl, that can't be undone
So here's a quarter, call someone who cares

[Chorus]
Call someone who'll listen, yeah, or might give a damn
Maybe one of your sordid affairs
But don't you come around here handing me none of your lies
Here's a quarter, call someone who cares

[Outro]
Yeah, here's a quarter, call someone who cares
Yeah, yeah
