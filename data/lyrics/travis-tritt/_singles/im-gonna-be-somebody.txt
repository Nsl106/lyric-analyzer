[Verse 1]
Bobby played his guitar on the harder side of town
Where it's hard for a poor boy to find the money
He had dedication, he had the heart and soul
Somehow knew he was born to play

[Verse 2]
People said "Get a real job, support your family
'Cause there's no future on the road you're takin'"
He never said a word, the dreamer just kept on
Late at night you could hear him say

[Chorus]
He said, "I'm gonna be somebody
One of these days I'm gonna break these chains
I'm gonna be somebody someday
You can bet your hard-earned dollar I will"

[Verse 3]
The road was a struggle, took him ten years to the top
And now he's number one on the stage and the radio
Still he can't believe how people come from miles around
When it seems like only yesterday when he would say

[Chorus]
"I'm gonna be somebody
One of these days I'm gonna break these chains
I'm gonna be somebody someday
You can bet your hard-earned dollar I will"

[Verse 4]
Bobby played his hometown one full moon August night
When he heard a voice in the front row singin'
It was a sandy-haired rebel boy with the same ol' hungry eyes
He looked up at Bobby and said

[Chorus]
"I'm gonna be somebody
One of these days I'm gonna break these chains
And I'm gonna be somebody someday
You can bet your hard-earned dollar I will
You know I will, yeah"

[Chorus]
I'm gonna be somebody
One of these days I'm gonna break these chains
And I'm gonna be somebody someday
You can bet your hard-earned dollar I will, oh yeah
You can bet your hard-earned dollar I will
