[Verse 1]
You know you shouldn't be here
What am I suppose to do?
You know I've found a new love
And I'm trying to be true
Didn't you say that we were over?
Why do you keep hanging on?
You're no longer welcome
Can't you just leave us alone?

[Chorus]
What's a memory like you
Doing in a love like this?
She thinks we're all through
But that's not the way it is
When I hold her in my arms
It's your lips I still kiss
What's a memory like you
Doing in a love like this?

[Verse 2]
Don't you know it would hurt her
To find you here with me?
Why make me remember
The way we used to be?
Can't you see that she can love me
The way you never could?
And I really want to love her
Ain't it time you left for good?

[Chorus]
What's a memory like you
Doing in a love like this?
She thinks we're all through
But that's not the way it is
When I hold her in my arms
It's your lips I still kiss
What's a memory like you
Doing in a love like this?

[Outro]
What's a memory like you
Doing in a love like this?
