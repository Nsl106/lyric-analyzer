[Verse 1]
Hush, don't talk now
It won't change anything anyhow
Just hold me while the shadows bring us near
I know you're not in love with me
I'm not askin' you to be
And there's no use pretending why we're here

[Chorus]
You don't need to try and fool me
You don't need to lead me on
You don't need to say you love me
I've been around enough to know

[Verse 2]
Wait, don't tell a lie
Cause I just might believe it tonight
And I know you're only tryin' to ease your mind
But don't worry it's all right
I don't care if it's wrong or it's right
Just hold me close and love me one more time

[Chorus]
You don't need to try and fool me
You don't need to lead me on
You don't need to say you love me
I've been around enough to know

You don't need to say you love me
I've been around enough to know
