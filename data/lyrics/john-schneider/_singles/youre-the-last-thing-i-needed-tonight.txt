Now I don't need someone for new inspiration
And I don't need a strong drink or two
No soft lights, music, or warm conversation
There's no substitution for you
Cause I've got all that I need to be happy
Cause your love makes everything right
You're the first thing that I'll need tomorrow
And you're the last thing I needed tonight

You're the last thing I needed
You always are
I can't wait for the day to end
You're the last thing I needed
To hold in my arms
If I should never wake up again

Now I always find you
Somewhere in my dreams
And I know when I close my eyes
You'll be the first thing that I'll need tomorrow
And the last thing I needed tonight

You're the first thing that I'll need tomorrow
And you're the last thing I needed tonight
