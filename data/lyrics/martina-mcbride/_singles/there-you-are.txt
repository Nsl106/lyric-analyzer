[Verse 1]
There you are in the early light of day
There you are in the quiet words I pray
I've been blessed by the simple happiness
Of the perfect love we've made

[Chorus]
Every time I turn around
When I'm lost and when I'm found
Like an angel standing guard
There you are
Every time I take a breath
And when I forget to breathe
You're watching over me
There you are
When I'm looking for the light
In the middle of the night
Searching for the brightest star
There you are

[Verse 2]
There you are, standing in a crowded room
There you are, the Earth and I'm the moon
My desire is to stand by the fire
That burns inside of you

[Chorus]
Every time I turn around
When I'm lost and when I'm found
Like an angel standing guard
There you are
Every time I take a breath
And when I forget to breathe
You're watching over me
There you are
When I'm looking for the light
In the middle of the night
Searching for the brightest star
There you are
When I'm looking for the light
In the middle of the night
Searching for the brightest star
There you are
There you are
There you are
