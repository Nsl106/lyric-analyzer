[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
The sun is shining everyday
The clouds never get in the way for you and me
I've known you just a week or two
But baby I'm so into you
Can hardly breathe

[Chorus 1]
And I'm in so totally wrapped up
Emotionally attracted
So physically acting
So recklessly I need you
So desperately sure as the sky is blue
Baby, I love you
I love you

[Verse 2]
I never knew that I could feel like this
Can hardly wait till our next kiss
You're so cool
If I'm dreaming, please don't wake me up
Because baby I can't get enough
Of what you do

[Chorus 2]
And I'm in so electrically charged up
Kinetically acting
Erratically need you
Fanatically you get to me
Magically sure as the sky is blue
Baby, I love you

[Bridge]
I, I can't believe that this is real
The way I feel
Baby, I'm gone head over heels
(Head over heels)

[Chorus 1]
And I'm in so totally wrapped up
Emotionally attracted
So physically acting
So recklessly I need you
So desperately sure as the sky is blue
Yeah

[Chorus 2]
And I'm in so electrically charged up
Kinetically acting
Erratically need you
Fanatically you get to me
Magically sure as the sky is blue
Baby, I love you

[Outro]
Baby, I love you
Do you love me too
Baby, I love you
