[Verse 1]
She loved him like he was
The last man on Earth
Gave him everything she ever had
He'd break her spirit down
Then come loving up on her
Give a little, then take it back

[Verse 2]
She'd tell him 'bout her dreams
He'd just shoot 'em down
Lord, he loved to make her cry
"You're crazy for believing
You'll ever leave the ground"
He said, "Only angels know how to fly"

[Chorus]
And with a broken wing
She still sings
She keeps an eye on the sky
With a broken wing (Ooh)
She carries her dreams
Man, you oughta see her fly

[Verse 3]
One Sunday morning
She didn't go to church
He wondered why she didn't leave
He went up to the bedroom
Found a note by the window
With the curtains blowin' in the breeze

[Chorus]
And with a broken wing
She still sings
She keeps an eye on the sky
With a broken wing (Ooh)
She carries her dreams
Man, you oughta see her fly
With a broken wing (Ooh)
She carries her dreams
Man, you oughta see her fly

[Outro]
(With a broken wing, ooh)
