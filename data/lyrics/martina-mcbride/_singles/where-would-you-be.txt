[Verse 1]
I wonder where your heart is 'cause it sure don't feel like it's here
Sometimes I think you wish that I would just disappear
Have I got it all wrong?
Have you felt this way long?
Are you already gone?

[Verse 2]
Do you feel lonely when you're here by my side?
Does the sound of freedom echo in your mind?
Do you wish you were by yourself
Or that I was someone else
Anyone else?

[Chorus]
Where would you be if you weren't here with me?
Where would you go if you were single and free?
Who would you love? Would it be me?
Where would you be?

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna hold you back, no, I don't wanna slow you down
I don't wanna make you feel like you are tied up and bound
'Cause that's not what love's about
If there's no chance we can work it out
Tell me now
Oh, tell me, tell me now

[Chorus]
Where would you be if you weren't here with me?
Where would you go if you were single and free?
Who would you love? Would it be me?
Where would you be?

[Bridge]
Have I become the enemy?
Is it hard to be yourself in my company?

[Chorus]
Where would you be if you weren't here with me?
Where would you go if you were single and free?
Who would you love? Would it be me?
Where would you be?

[Outro]
Oh tell me, tell me now
Where would you be?
Where would you go?
Who would you love?
Would it be me?
