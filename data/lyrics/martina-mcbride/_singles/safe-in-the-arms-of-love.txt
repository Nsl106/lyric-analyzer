[Verse 1]
My heart's not ready for the rocking chair
I need somebody who really cares
So tired of living solitaire

[Refrain]
Someday I'm gonna be
Safe in the arms of love

[Verse 2]
Strip your heart and it starts to snow
Love is a high-wire act I know
Someday I'll find a net below, oh

[Refrain]
Someday I'm gonna be
Safe in the arms of love
Safe in the arms of love (Love)

[Chorus]
I want arms that know how to rock me
Safe in the arms of love
I wanna fall and know that love has caught me
Safe in the arms of love
Safe in the arms of love (Love)

[Post-Chorus]
(Safe, safe)
(Ah, ah)

[Verse 3]
I want a heart to be forever mine
Want eyes to see me satisfied
Gonna hang my heartache out to dry, oh

[Refrain]
Someday I'm gonna be
Safe in the arms of love
Safe in the arms of love (Love)

[Chorus]
I want arms that know how to rock me
Safe in the arms of love
I wanna fall and know that love has caught me
Safe in the arms of love
Safe in the arms of love
Safe in the arms of love (Love)
