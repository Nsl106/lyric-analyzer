[Verse 1]
I ain't complainin’
But I'm tired, so I'm just sayin’ what I think
And if we're bein’ honest, then honestly
I think I need a drink

[Verse 2]
My baby's growin’ up
She think's she's fallin’ all in love and that I hate her
At seventeen, she's just like me when I was seventeen
So I don't blame her

[Pre-Chorus]
Do do-do-do
Do do-do-do
What are we gonna to do?
Do do-do-do
Do do-do-do
What are we gonna do about it?

[Chorus]
Remember when we used to be
Everything they’d ever need?
We had them believin’ we were cool
It's like it happened overnight
We're always wrong, they’re always right
We used to be the ones breakin’ the rules
Now we're just mothers and we're just fathers of
Teenage daughters

[Verse 3]
She rolls her eyes when I'm funny
But she's sweet when she wants money and her freedom
Oh my god, she's got a car
Swears they won't go far
And I wish I believed ‘em

[Pre-Chorus]
Do do-do-do
Do do-do-do
What are we gonna do?
Do do-do-do
Do do-do-do
What are we gonna do about it?

[Chorus]
Remember when we used to be
Everything they’d ever need?
We had them believin’ we were cool
It's like it happened overnight
We're always wrong, they’re always right
We used to be the ones breakin’ the rules
Now we're just mothers, yeah we're just fathers of
Teenage daughters

[Bridge]
They’re beautiful, wild and free
Everything we wish we could be
But they’re still crazy
Oh, you know they make us crazy

[Chorus]
Remember when we used to be
Everything they’d ever need?
We had them believin’ we were cool
It's like it happened overnight
We're always wrong, they’re always right
We used to be the ones breakin’ the rules
Now we're just mothers and we're just fathers of
Teenage daughters
Yeah, teenage daughters

[Outro]
I ain't complainin’
But I'm tired, so I'm just sayin’ what I think
If we're bein’ honest, then honestly
I think I need a drink
