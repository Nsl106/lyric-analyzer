[Verse 1]
I used to live in a darkened room
Had a face of stone and a heart of gloom
Lost my hope, I was so far gone
Crying all my tears with the curtains drawn
I didn't know until my soul broke free
I've got these angels watching over me

[Chorus]
Oh, watch me go
I'm a happy girl, everybody knows
That the sweetest thing that you'll ever see
In the whole wide world is a happy girl

[Verse 2]
I used to hide in a party crowd
Bottled up inside, feeling so left out
Standing in a corner wearing concrete shoes
With my frozen smile and my lighted fuse
Now every time I start to feel like that
I roll my heart out like a welcome mat

[Chorus]
Oh, watch me go
I'm a happy girl, everybody knows
That the sweetest thing that you'll ever see
In the whole wide world is a happy girl

[Bridge]
Laugh when I feel like it
Cry when I feel like it
That's just how my life is
That's how it goes

[Chorus]
Oh, watch me go
I'm a happy girl, and I've come to know
That the world won't change just 'cause I complain
Let the axis twirl, I'm a happy girl
Oh, watch me go
I'm a happy girl, everybody knows
That the sweetest thing that you'll ever see
In the whole wide world is a happy girl

[Outro]
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, I'm a happy girl
