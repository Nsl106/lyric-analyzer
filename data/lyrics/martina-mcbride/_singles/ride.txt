Yeah ahh yeah

[Verse 1]
You wake up from your dream and, and you don’t want to face the day
You can’t find a reason to think your world will ever change
You can hide beneath the covers
Or you can run outside head up high and carry on

[Chorus]
Life is a roller coaster ride
Time Turns a Wheel and Love Collides
Faith is believing you can close your eyes and touch the sky
So Shine while you have the chance to shine
Laugh even when you want to cry
Hold on tight to what you feel inside and ride…

[Verse 2]
It brings you up slowly then shoot you like a rocket towards the ground
It twists and it shakes you before it turns you upside down
You can’t see what’s around the corner
And You can’t look back, so just live it up and feel the rush

[Chorus]
Life is a roller coaster ride
Time Turns a Wheel and Love Collides
Faith is believing you can close your eyes and touch the sky
So Shine while you have the chance to shine
Laugh even when you want to cry
Hold on tight to what you feel inside and ride…

Ride, ride, ahh yeah, yeah

Oh yeah

[Chorus]
Shine while you have the chance to shine
Laugh even when you want to cry
Hold on tight to what you feel inside and ride

Ride, ride, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!!!!
