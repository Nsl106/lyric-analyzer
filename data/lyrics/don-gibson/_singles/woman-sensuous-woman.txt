[Chorus]
Woman (Ooh), sensuous woman
You control the world I'm living in
Woman (Ooh), sensuous woman
Release my body and let me live again

[Verse 1]
Step by step, you taught me easy lovin'
Night by night, you caught me in your web
My self-control was overruled by passion
I couldn't see the heartaches just ahead

[Chorus]
Woman (Ooh), sensuous woman
You control the world I'm living in
Woman (Ooh), sensuous woman
Release my body and let me live again

[Verse 2]
Someone's true at home, I should be with her
And she don't know I crave your ecstasy
But many hearts will break if I don't conquer
This lustful spell you cast all over me

[Chorus]
Woman (Ooh), sensuous woman
You control the world I'm living in
Woman (Ooh), sensuous woman
Release my body and let me live again

[Outro]
Release my body and let me live again
