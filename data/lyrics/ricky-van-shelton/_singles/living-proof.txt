She hangs up the phone and her heart starts to pound
Someone just told her an old friend's in town
And a million old feelings come rushing in
Start tearing to pieces what it took years to mend

She's living proof, true love never dies
Through all of the heartaches and all the goodbyes
She just can't forget it, Lord knows, she's tried
She's living proof, true love never dies

You answer the door and I say, "Hello"
If you don't want to see me, just tell me, I'll go
But I can't love without you, it's only pretend
There's no love like you're sweet love, can we try it again?

We're living proof, true love never dies
Through all of the heartaches and all the goodbyes
I just can't forget you, Lord knows, I've tried
We're living proof, true love never dies
Yes, we're living proof, true love never dies
