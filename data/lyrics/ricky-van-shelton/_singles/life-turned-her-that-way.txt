[Verse 1]
If she seems cold and bitter, then I beg of you
Just stop and consider all she's gone through
Don't be quick to condemn her for things she might say
Just remember, life turned her that way

[Chorus]
She's been walked on and stepped on so many times
And I hate to admit it, but the last footprint's mine
She was cryin' when I met her, she cries harder today
So, don't blame her, life turned her that way

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
She's been walked on and stepped on so many times
And I hate to admit it, but the last footprint's mine
She was cryin' when I met her, she cries harder today
So, don't blame her, life turned her that way

[Outro]
So, don't blame her, life turned her that way
