[Verse 1]
Walk away, leave with my blessing
Once in a while, let me hear from you
If we never meet again before my life is over
I'll leave this world loving you

[Verse 2]
You can take everything but my memories
For they're good ones and they'll see me through
If we never meet again, I'll love you forever
I'll leave this world loving you

[Chorus]
You were mine for a time and I'm thankful
Oh, but life will be so lonesome without you
If we never meet again, this side of heaven
I'll leave this world loving you

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
If we never meet again this side of heaven
I'll leave this world loving you
