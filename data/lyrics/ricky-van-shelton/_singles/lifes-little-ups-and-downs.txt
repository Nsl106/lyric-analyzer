I don't know how to tell her
I didn't get that raise in pay today
And I know how much she wanted
The dress in Baker's window
And it breaks my heart to see her have to wait
Cancel all the plans she made to celebrate

I can count on her to take it with a smile
And not a frown, she knows that

Life has its little ups and downs
Like ponies on a merry go round
And no one grabs the brass ring every time
But she don't mind
She wears a gold ring on her finger
And I'm so glad that it's mine

The new house plans we've had so long
I guess, will gather dust another year
And the daffodils are bloomin'
That she planted way last fall upon the hill
Over by the gate

Lord knows, I hate to say again, we'll have to wait
But you can bet that she'll just take it with a smile
And not a frown, she knows that

Life has its little ups and downs
Like ponies on a merry go round
And no one grabs the brass ring every time
But she don't mind
She wears a gold ring on her finger
And I'm so glad that it's mine

She wears a gold ring on her finger
And I'm so glad that it's mine
