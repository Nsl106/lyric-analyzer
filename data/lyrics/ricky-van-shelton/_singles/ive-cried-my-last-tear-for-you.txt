When you left me lonely here
I thought that I would drown in tears
As one was wiped away
Another one would take its place
Drop by drop, as time went by
I slowly ran that river dry
Until I finally realized today

That I've cried my last tear for you
Wasted my last year on you
There's no trace of the heartache I knew
It's been raining pain since you walked out
But, baby, that's all over now
'Cause I've cried my last tear for you

Well, I used to lay alone in bed
With my pillow soaking wet
And all of those lonely nights
I thought there was no end in sight
I cried my heart out over you
But then I cried the hurt out too
It took a while, but now I'll be alright

But I've cried my last tear for you
Wasted my last year on you
There's no trace of the heartache I knew
Well, it's been raining pain since you walked out
But, baby, that's all over now
'Cause I've cried my last tear for you
Yes, baby, I've cried my last tear for you
