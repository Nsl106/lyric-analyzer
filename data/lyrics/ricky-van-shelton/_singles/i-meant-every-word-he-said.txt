I heard him say: I love you
I heard him say: Forever
And without you, he'd rather be dead
I felt my hands shaking
I felt my heart breaking
'Cause I meant every word he said

I saw him whisper something
Then I saw you look so happy
It's a look I won't ever forget
'Cause whatever he told you
Meant I'd never hold you
And I meant every word he said

His heart stole those words from my head
Now, it's too late to tell you what he's already said

I heard him say: I love you
I heard him say: Forever
Then he said: With this ring, I thee wed
And when he said: I do
I choked back: I do, too
And I meant every word he said

His heart stole those words from my head
Now it's too late to tell you what he's already said

I heard him say: I love you
I heard him say: Forever
Then he said: With this ring, I thee wed
And when he said: I do
I choked back: I do, too
'Cause I meant every word he said
