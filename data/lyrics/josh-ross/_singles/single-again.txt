[Verse 1]
I know I shouldn't say "What's up?"
I heard you went and met someone
But I got a little cold beer buzz and he ain't here right now
I bet you if I took your hand
That we had a neon night slow dance
You'd be gettin' to forgettin' all about him
And you'd be walkin' outta here without him

[Chorus]
When you're single again
And you're thinkin' of me
You know I got that same old Tennessee
Six-one-five that you used to hit up
A half past "Where you at? Pick me up"
When you're all over him
I hope you're all over me
I got a king sized bed
Just missin' a queen
Makе me your first call
After your last call with him
And you won't evеr be single again

[Verse 2]
I got a Cabernet with your name on it
A slow drive on a Sunday, you can count on it
I'll treat you better than he ever did
Girl when we're together you won't ever wish

[Chorus]
That you're single again
And you're thinkin' of me
You know I got that same old Tennessee
Six-one-five that you used to hit up
A half past "Where you at? Pick me up"
When you're all over him
I hope your're all over me
I got a king sized bed
Just missin' a queen
Make me your first call
After your last call with him
And you won't ever be single again
Oh, single again
Single again

[Chorus]
So when you're single again
And you're thinkin' of me
You know I got that same old Tennessee yeah
Six-one-five that you used to hit up
A half past "Where you at? Pick me up"
When you're all over him
I hope you're all over me
I got a king sized bed
Just missin' a queen
Make me your first call
After your last call with him
And you won't ever be single again
Oh, single again
Single again
Single again
