We meet on the street and we play word games
Saying words that cover up what’s real
Your close enough to touch and we play word games
Hiding all the things we really feel

I say hello what's new
And what I mean is darling I miss you
You say I'm looking good
And I wonder if you mean your lonely too

We meet on the street and we play word games
Saying words that cover up what’s real
Your close enough to touch and we play word games
Hiding all the things we really feel

I say it looks like rain and what I mean is
Please don't let it end
You say time really flies
And I wonder if you mean you'll try again

We meet on the street and we play word games
Saying words that cover up what’s real
Your close enough to touch and we play word games
Hiding all the things we really feel
Hiding all the things we really feel
