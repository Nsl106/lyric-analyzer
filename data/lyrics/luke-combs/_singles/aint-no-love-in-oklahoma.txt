[Verse 1]
I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the same old dead-end highway
Riding that storm running through my veins
Like a shot down tailspun airplane
Scared of nothing and I'm scared to death
I can't breathe and I catch my breath
But I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the same old dead-end highway

[Chorus]
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain

[Verse 2]
I got saved in the same Red River
The same Red River tryna drown me
It ain't knocking me down, I'm standing my ground
With the whole world falling all around me
I keep running, but I'm standing still
Pray for peace, but I need thе thrill
So I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the samе old dead-end highway

[Chorus]
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain

[Chorus]
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain
