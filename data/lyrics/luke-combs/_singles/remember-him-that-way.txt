[Verse 1]
There's an old man in a La-Z-Boy
TV on a Western, fast asleep
Grey in his hair, at least what's left
But the heart of a lion, beatin' in his chest

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's a little more slow in his go
A little less rock in his roll, these days

[Chorus]
But I remember him ten feet tall and bulletproof
Throwin' me a ball in cowboy boots
A whistle and the dogs start runnin'
A whisper and Mama starts blushin'
A wrench in his hand and a beer in the other
God couldn't make a man any tougher
And that "S" on his chest is startin' to fade
But I'll always remember him that way

[Verse 2]
I used to think, that he'd never gеt old
That kind of thing was for regular Joes
And he triеs real hard, to put up a fight
But I guess time, is his kryptonite

[Chorus]
'Cause I remember him ten feet tall and bulletproof
Throwin' me a ball in cowboy boots
A whistle and the dogs start runnin'
A whisper and Mama starts blushin'
A wrench in his hand and a beer in the other
God couldn't make a man any tougher
And that "S" on his chest is startin' to fade
But I'll always remember him that way

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a little more slow in his go
A little less rock in his roll, these days

[Chorus]
But I remember him ten feet tall and bulletproof
Throwin' me a ball in cowboy boots
A whistle and the dogs start runnin'
A whisper and Mama starts blushin'
A wrench in his hand and a beer in the other
God couldn't make a man any tougher
And that "S" on his chest is startin' to fade
But there's some things time can't erase
'Cause I'll always remember him that way
