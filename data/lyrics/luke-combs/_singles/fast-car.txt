[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
Been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the bordеr and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to bе livin'

[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for workin'
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, "Somebody's gotta take care of him"
So I quit school and that's what I did

[Refrain]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruisin', entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
