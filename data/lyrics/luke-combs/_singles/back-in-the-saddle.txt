[Verse 1]
I've been gone for a little too long
I've been waitin' on the drummer to kick off a comeback song
I've been waitin' in the wings like a dog on a chain
I can feel this fire buildin' up a little wild in it
Went and checked the wire, sure enough, there's live in it
Try to stop it, but I can't
It's callin' my name

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm back in the saddle like some old cowboy, who dug his way out of his grave
Pulled up his boots, put his pistol on his hip, climbed up and took hold of the reins
Don't worry where I've been, I'm back in the saddle again

[Verse 2]
This time, I'm takin' what's mine
Like a long lost out west outlaw outta his mind
I'm ridin' into town, no turnin' back now

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm back in the saddle like some old cowboy, who dug his way out of his grave
Pulled up his boots, put his pistol on his hip, climbed up and took hold of the reins
Don't worry where I've been, I'm back in the saddle again

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm back in the saddle like some old cowboy, who dug his way out of his grave
Pulled up his boots, put his pistol on his hip, climbed up and took hold of the reins
Don't worry where I've been, I'm back in the saddle again
Don't worry where I've been, I'm back in the saddle again
