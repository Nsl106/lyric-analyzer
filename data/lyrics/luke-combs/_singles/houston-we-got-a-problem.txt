[Verse 1]
This is my kinda town
This is my kinda place
I wouldn't mind hangin' 'round
For more than just a couple days
I got a 12th floor room
With a killer view
Of the empty Astrodome
Got a tab at the bar downstairs
But all I can think about is home

[Chorus]
I got my new boots covered in red dirt
A "Don't Mess With Texas" t-shirt
And a Lonestar postcard postmarked with "Missin' you"
It's got the biggest sky you've ever seen
The coldest beer you'd ever drink
But I still feel like I landed on the moon
'Cause it ain't got you
Houston, we got a problem

[Verse 2]
You should've seen 19th Street
You should've seen a midnight rodeo
The way them saloon doors swing
When they line dance to "Copperhead Road"
Something 'bout the air down here
That'll make you feel
The way all them cowboys do
I wish I was an outlaw
But all I can think about is you

[Chorus]
I got my new boots covered in red dirt
A "Don't Mess With Texas" t-shirt
And a Lonestar postcard postmarked with "Missin' you"
It's got the biggest sky you've ever seen
The coldest beer you'd ever drink
But I still feel like I landed on the moon
'Cause it ain't got you
Houston, we got a problem

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus/Outro]
It's got the biggest sky you've ever seen
The coldest beer you'd ever drink
But I still feel like I landed on the moon
'Cause it ain't got you
Houston, we got a problem
Houston, we got a problem
Houston, we got a problem
