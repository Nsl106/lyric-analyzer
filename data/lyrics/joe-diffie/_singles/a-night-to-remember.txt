[Verse 1]
Been one tough week
I'm dead on my feet
But I've made plans for tonight
When I'm feelin' blue
Know just what to do
And how to make it right

[Pre-Chorus]
Seems like I've needed this forever
Gonna have myself a night to remember

[Chorus]
Dim the lights, lock the door
Spread your pictures on the floor
Blow the dust off of our past
Let it all come floodin' back
'Cause it ain't easy bein' strong
And when I can't forget you're gone
I just surrender
And have myself a night to remember

[Verse 2]
Sad ain't my style
But once in a while
I just have to give in
'Cause a woman like you
Is so hard to lose
You just don't want it to end

[Pre-Chorus]
I know this can't go on forever
So tonight I'll have a night to remember

[Chorus]
Dim the lights, lock the door
Spread your pictures on the floor
Blow the dust off of our past
Let it all come floodin' back
'Cause it ain't easy bein' strong
And when I can't forget you're gone
I just surrender
And have myself a night to remember

[Outro]
Oh, it ain't easy bein' strong
And when I can't forget you're gone
I just surrender
Have myself a night to remember
