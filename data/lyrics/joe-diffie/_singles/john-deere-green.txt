[Verse 1]
They were farm kids way down in Dixie
They met in high school in the '60s
Everyone knew it was love from the start
One July, in the midnight hour
He climbed up on the water tower
Stood on the rail and painted a ten-foot heart

[Chorus]
In John Deere green, on a hot summer night
He wrote, "Billy Bob loves Charlene," in letters three-foot-high
And the whole town said that he should've used red
But it looked good to Charlene in John Deere green

[Verse 2]
They settled down on eighty acres
Raisin' sweet corn, kids, and tomatoes
They went together like a hand in a glove
On a clear day, from their front yard
If you look and know what to look for
Off to the east, you can still read his words of love

[Chorus]
In John Deere green, on a hot summer night
He wrote, "Billy Bob loves Charlene," in letters three-foot-high
And the whole town said, "The boy should've used red"
But it looked good to Charlene in John Deere green

[Bridge]
Now more than once the town has discovered
Painting over it ain't no use
There ain't no paint in the world that'll cover it
The heart keeps showin' through

[Chorus]
In John Deere green on a hot summer night
He wrote, "Billy Bob loves Charlene," in letters three-foot-high
And the whole town said, "The fool should've used red"
But it looked good to Charlene in John Deere green

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Ah, paint it green, boy

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
In John Deere green on a hot summer night
He wrote, "Billy Bob loves Charlene," in letters three-foot-high
And the whole town said, "The boy should've used red"
But it looked good to Charlene in John Deere green

[Outro]
John Deere green
