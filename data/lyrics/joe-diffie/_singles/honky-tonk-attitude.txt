[Verse 1]
Well, the beer's on the bar and the smoke fills the air
There's a fool in every corner, man, that just don't care
Tight pants, line dance, Stetson hats and cowboy boots
They got a Friday night, get right, honky tonk attitude

[Verse 2]
Well, the waitress never leaves you with a half-empty glass
And every girl's on the dance floor shaking her
Well, it's a two-step, three-step, outta step country groove
They got a Friday night, get right, honky tonk attitude

[Chorus]
Well, now everybody knows that's where everybody goes
Just to dance away their blues
So leave your cares behind, it's just a state of mind
What have you got to lose?

[Refrain]
Hey bartender, pour up another round
We're just getting started, don't shut us down
We need a slow dance, romanced, last chance rendezvous
We need a Friday night, get right, honky tonk attitude

[Chorus]
Well, now everybody knows that's where everybody goes
Just to dance away their blues
So leave your cares behind, it's just a state of mind
What have you got to lose?
What have you got to lose?

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Hey bartender, pour up another round
We're just getting started, don't shut us down
We need a slow dance, romanced, last chance rendezvous
We need a Friday night, get right, honky tonk attitude

[Chorus]
Well now, everybody knows that's where everybody goes
Just to dance away their blues
So leave your cares behind, it's just a state of mind
What have you got to lose?
But what have you got to lose

[Outro]
If you've got a Friday night, get right honky tonk attitude
Yeah, you need a Friday night, get right honky tonk attitude
