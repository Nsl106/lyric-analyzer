[Verse 1]
Downtown, stoplight
Red car rolls by
What else can I do
But wonder if it's you?
Scannin' the stations
Every song they're playin'
Is like a soundtrack
To the love we had

[Pre-Chorus]
I should be over you by now
But every time I turn around

[Chorus]
It's always somethin' every day remindin' me
Everywhere I go, there's a memory
Ready and a-waitin' to catch me off guard
There's no way to prepare my heart
Oh, what I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't do
If only I could just stop missin' you
I'd let go of our love like it was never nothin'
But it's always somethin'

[Verse 2]
Lunch time, a new place
Waitress says her name
Why does it have to be
Emily?
Corner store, stop in
Someone ask, "How ya been?"
I say, "I wouldn't know
I really gotta go"

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish I could forget you, but I don't know how
'Cause every time I turn around

[Chorus]
It's always somethin' every day remindin' me
Everywhere I go, there's a memory
Ready and a-waitin' to catch me off guard
There's no way to prepare my heart
Oh, what I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't do
If only I could just stop missin' you
I'd let go of our love like it was never nothin'
But it's always somethin' every day remindin' me
Everywhere I go, there's a memory
Ready and a-waitin' to catch me off guard
There's no way to prepare my heart
Oh, what I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't do
If only I could just stop missin' you
I'd let go of our love like it was never nothin'
But it's always somethin'

[Outro]
It's always somethin'
Oh, it's always somethin' (Every day remindin' me)
It's always somethin'
