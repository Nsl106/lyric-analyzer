[Verse 1]
You could've kissed me, like this wasn't gonna last
Kept me from sayin' somethin' I'll never take back
You could have held me like there was no chance of me wakin' up where I am
You could have stopped short of every dream I've ever had

[Chorus]
So help me, girl, you've gone too far
It's way too late to save my heart
The way it feels each time we touch
I know I've never been so loved
And I can't help myself
So help me, girl

[Verse 2]
You had to be there when that old sun came up
Makin' last night feel like a vision of things yet to come
You just had to hold me like nobody else, now look what you've gone and done
You had to love me 'til I just can't get enough

[Chorus]
So help me, girl, you've gone too far
It's way too late to save my heart
The way it feels each time we touch
I know I've never been so loved
And I can't help myself
So help me, girl

[Chorus]
So help me, girl, you've gone too far
It's way too late to save my heart
The way it feels each time we touch
I know I've never been so loved
And I can't help myself
So help me, girl

[Outro]
Now I can't help myself
So help me, girl
