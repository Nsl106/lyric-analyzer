[Verse 1]
A little Miss Dynamite just blew my world away
It was a pitiful sight, me begging her to stay
I never had a hunch, so how was I to know
That she packed a punch that knocked my heart out cold?

[Chorus]
She put a hurtin' on this old cowboy
Broke my heart like a little play toy
Brought me to my knees from ten feet tall
The night she left me in Amarillo
I cried crocodile tears in my pillow
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
How could a blue-eyed beauty only five-foot-three
Lay a Texas-size heartache on me?

[Verse 2]
She came across so cool, I didn't think that I'd get burned
Now I'm a big ol' fool with a leavin' lesson learned
Thought I was strong like ol' Hercules
She proved me wrong with her little c'est la vie

[Chorus]
She put a hurtin' on this old cowboy
Broke my heart like a little play toy
Brought me to my knees from ten feet tall
The night she left me in Amarillo
I cried crocodile tears in my pillow
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
How could a blue-eyed beauty only five-foot-three
Lay a Texas-size heartache on me?

[Outro]
How could a blue-eyed beauty only five-foot-three
Lay a Texas-size heartache on me?
