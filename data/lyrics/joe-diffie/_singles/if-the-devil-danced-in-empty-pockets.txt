[Verse 1]
Diablo Motors had a hell of a sale downtown yesterday
Word got around, no money down, take years and years to pay
When I got there, the lot was bare, but the salesman said, "Hold on
For a little cash, I got a two-tone Nash out behind my barn"

[Chorus]
If the devil danced in empty pockets
He'd have a ball in mine
With a nine-foot grand, a ten-piece band
And a twelve-girl chorus line
I'd raise some loot in a three-piece suit
Give him one dance for a dime
If the devil danced in empty pockets
He'd have a ball in mine

[Verse 2]
Well, he said, "Friend, it ain't the end, let's see what I can do
If you own a home, I've got a loan tailor-made for you"
Then above the racket, a voice in my jacket said, "I'll tote the note"
The devil made me do it, talked me into it, and that was all she wrote

[Chorus]
If the devil danced in empty pockets
He'd have a ball in mine
With a nine-foot grand, a ten-piece band
And a twelve-girl chorus line
I'd raise some loot in a three-piece suit
Give him one dance for a dime
If the devil danced in empty pockets
He'd have a ball in mine

[Bridge]
They say debt is a bottomless pit where the devil likes to play
I'd sell my soul to get out of this hole, but there'd be hell to pay

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
If the devil danced in empty pockets
He'd have a ball in mine
With a nine-foot grand, a ten-piece band
And a twelve-girl chorus line
I'd raise some loot in a three-piece suit
Give him one dance for a dime
If the devil danced in empty pockets
He'd have a ball in mine
