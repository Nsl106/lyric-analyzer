Darlin' I'll pack up my clothes
Take my heart on down the road
I'll even make believe I don't love you
Lose my mind, go insane
Turn my face to the pourin' rain
There's nothing I wouldn't do if you want me to

But I'd rather stay around and love you
And be the one to make your dreams come true
But if it takes goodbye to make you happy
Then I'll just walk away if you want me to

If there's no way to make it work
I'll find a way to hide the hurt
I'll do my best to do what's best for you
I'll just take your memory
And disappear quietly
Quit acting like a fool if you want me to

But I'd rather stay around and love you
And be the one to make your dreams come true
But if it takes good-bye to make you happy
Then I'll just walk away if you want me to

Oh, if it takes goodbye to make you happy
Then I'll just walk away if you want me to
