[Chorus]
I'm gonna find me a new way to light up an old flame
With a little bit of luck and a hug, there's gonna be a big change
I got a strong desire to start the kind of fire
That'll burn through a pouring rain
I'm gonna find me a new way to light up an old flame

[Verse 1]
I've had all that I can stand
I've got roses in my hand
And old feelings in my heart
Now I'm knocking on her door
I can't stay away no more
'Cause we're no good apart

[Chorus]
I'm gonna find me a new way to light up an old flame
With a little bit of luck and a hug, there's gonna be a big change
I got a strong desire to start the kind of fire
That'll burn through a pouring rain
I'm gonna find me a new way to light up an old flame
Ah, get it, boys

[Verse 2]
I'm going take her out tonight
And put a spark back in her eyes
That'll never fade away
She'll see the love inside of me
A sight she never got to see
And she won't know what to say

[Chorus]
I'm gonna find me a new way to light up an old flame
With a little bit of luck and a hug, there's gonna be a big change
I got a strong desire to start the kind of fire
That'll burn through a pouring rain
I'm gonna find me a new way to light up an old flame

[Outro]
I got a strong desire to start the kind of fire
That'll burn through a pouring rain
I'm gonna find me a new way to light up an old flame
