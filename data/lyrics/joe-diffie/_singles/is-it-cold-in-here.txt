[Verse 1]
There's something wrong
Lord, I'm feeling a chill
That runs through my heart
Like a torch cuts through steel
You haven't said a word
Are you feeling it too?
Is it cold in here
Or is it just you?

[Chorus]
Did I leave the door wide open
And let the chill just kill that old desire?
Should I put my arms around you
Or put another log on the fire?
Is it my imagination
Or did the temperature just drop a notch or two?
Is it cold in here
Or is it just you?

[Verse 2]
There's no warmth at all
When I try to hold you near
You stare into space
As if I wasn't here
Did our love just die
Or is it just about to?
Is it cold in here
Or is it just you?

[Chorus]
Did I leave the door wide open
And let the chill just kill that old desire?
Should I put my arms around you
Or put another log on the fire?
Is it my imagination
Or did the temperature just drop a notch or two?
Is it cold in here
Or is it just you?

[Outro]
Oh, is it cold in here
Or is it just you?
