[Verse 1]
Bought it with cash, week's worth of cuttin' grass
From a senior in the parking lot
That faded ID looked a little like me
But honestly, it's still a long shot
So I studied every word, memorized every line
'Til I worked up the nerve one Friday night
Threw a case of beer up on the counter at a Circle K
Then I became

[Chorus]
David Ashley Parker from Powder Springs
November 27, turnin' twenty-three
Five-foot-nine, brown hair, blue eyes
Levi's, tee shirt, all-American guy
Made all the right moves, said all the right things
Showed up with the smokes and I bought all the drinks
Wasn't who I was, but every now and then, I got to be
David Ashley Parker from Powder Springs

[Verse 2]
That little plastic card got me into bars
Made me friends at the liquor store
Yeah, and I was a hit with the good-looking chicks
Every time I shot, I scored
From Macon to Athens to Daytona Beach
Yeah, I was the guy that could get what you need
It didn't even matter, I wasn't twenty-one
Had a Georgia license that said I was

[Chorus]
David Ashley Parker from Powder Springs
November 27, turnin' twenty-three
Five-foot-nine, brown hair, blue eyes
Levi's, tee shirt, all-American guy
Made all the right moves, said all the right things
Showed up with the smokes and I bought all the drinks
Wasn't who I was, but every now and then, I got to be
David Ashley Parker from Powder Springs

[Chorus]
I was David Ashley Parker from Powder Springs
November 27, turnin' twenty-three
Five-foot-nine, brown hair, blue eyes
Levi's, tee shirt, one hell of a guy
Made all the right moves, said all the right things
Showed up with the smokes and I bought all the drinks
Wasn't who I was, but every now and then, I got to be
Yeah, one of these days, I sure hope I get to meet
David Ashley Parker from Powder Springs
