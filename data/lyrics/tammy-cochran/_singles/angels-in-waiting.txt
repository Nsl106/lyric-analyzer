[Verse 1]
We camped out on the living room floor
In our old sleeping bags, by a make-believe fire
In our tent made of covers, we'd talk for hours
My two brothers and me
Keeping the faith; racing with destiny

[Chorus]
They were angels in waiting
Waiting for wings to fly from this world
Away from their pain
Treasuring time 'til time came to leave
Leaving behind, sweet memories
Angels in waiting; angels in waiting for wings

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
They always knew they'd never grow old
Sometimes the body is weaker than the soul
In their darkest hour, I made a promise
I will always keep
I'll give them life, I'll let them live through me

[Chorus]
They were angels in waiting
Waiting for wings to fly from this world
Away from their pain
Treasuring time 'til time came to leave
Leaving behind, sweet memories
Angels in waiting; angels in waiting for wings

[Chorus]
They were angels in waiting
Waiting for wings to fly from this world
Away from their pain
Treasuring time 'til time came to leave
Leaving behind, sweet memories
Angels in waiting; angels in waiting for wings

Angels in waiting; angels in waiting for me
