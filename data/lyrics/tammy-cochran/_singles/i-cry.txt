I don't miss you like I used to
I've pulled your pictures from the wall
I go just where and when I want to
I'm better off now, all in all

My heart ain't broken
It's through aching
And I'm movin on...

CHORUS:
But I cry a little bit everyday
At least one teardrop falls
It doesn't matter rain or shine
I try to leave it all behind
I swear that I'm alright
But in the middle of the night I cry

I used to hear your ghost calling
You'd never let me go to sleep
You always got your way now darling
But you won't get the best of me any longer
I'm stronger, I'm free...

CHORUS

Still I cry a little bit everyday
At least one teardrop falls
It doesn't matter rain or shine
I try to leave it all behind
I swear that I'm alright
But in the middle of the night I cry
I cry
I cry
