[Verse 1]
Got a call tonight saying we could still be friends
What a way to say goodbye, what a way to end
They say the darkest hour is just before dawn
So I'll just hold my head up and try to sing my song

[Chorus]
Better love next time
Just don't let me lose my mind
All I need's a real friend
To pick me up again
I got to shake these memories
If there's another chance for me
I'll be looking for a sign
Won't someone help me find
A better love next time?

[Verse 2]
I could sit around and hurt forever over you
But in my heart I know you're really gone
There must be a reason for the pain I'm going through
Telling me I'm not where I belong

[Chorus]
A better love next time
Just don't let me lose my mind
All I need's a real friend
To pick me up again
I got to shake these memories
If there's another chance for me
I'll be looking for a sign
Won't someone help me find
A better love next time?

[Outro]
Just as soon as I am strong
I'll be moving on
To a better love next time
