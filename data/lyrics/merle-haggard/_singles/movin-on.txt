[Chorus]
Big wheels rolling, big wheels rolling, moving on
Big wheels rolling, gotta keep 'em going
Big wheels rolling, moving on

[Verse 1]
The white line is the lifeline to a nation
And men like Will and Sonny make it move
Living like a gypsy always on the go
Doing what they best know how to do

[Verse 2]
Jamming gears has got to be a fever
'Cause men become addicted to the grind
It takes a special breed to be a truck-driving man
And a steady hand to pull that load behind

[Chorus]
Big wheels rolling, big wheels rolling, moving on
Big wheels rolling, got to keep them going
Big wheels rolling, moving on

[Verse 3]
All-night country music keeps 'em going
And Will and Sonny keep on moving on
A good hot cup of coffee is waiting up ahead
And the rhythm of the highway hums along

[Verse 2]
Jamming gears has got to be a fever
'Cause men become addicted to the grind
It takes a special breed to be a truck-driving man
And a steady hand to pull that load behind

[Chorus]
Big wheels rolling, big wheels rolling, moving on
Big wheels rolling, got to keep them going
Big wheels rolling, moving on
