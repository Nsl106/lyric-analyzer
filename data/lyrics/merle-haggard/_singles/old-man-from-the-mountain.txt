[Chorus]
The old man from the mountain's coming home home home
Thought I'd better warn you, so I called you on the phone
Get rid of Joe the grinder, you better be there alone
'Cause the old man from the mountain's coming home

[Verse 1]
I've been working in a sawmill, I'm all uptight and tense
I got wind that someone's been diggin' under my back fence
Thought I'd better call you, let you know today
That the old man from the mountain's on his way

[Chorus]
The old man from the mountain's coming home home home
Thought I'd better warn you, so I called you on the phone
Get rid of Joe the grinder, you better be there alone
'Cause the old man from the mountain's coming home
(Wind it up now)

[Verse 2]
Been working my dang fool head off all for a dollar bill
Now I need a bunch of good loving, so I'm comin' down the hill
Don't want no friendly Henrys warming up my bed
And the old man from the mountain means what he said

[Chorus]
The old man from the mountain's coming home home home
Thought I'd better warn you, so I called you on the phone
Get rid of Joe the grinder, you better be there alone
'Cause the old man from the mountain's coming home

[Chorus]
The old man from the mountain's coming home home home
Thought I'd better warn you, so I called you on the phone
Get rid of Joe the grinder, you better be there alone
'Cause the old man from the mountain's coming home
