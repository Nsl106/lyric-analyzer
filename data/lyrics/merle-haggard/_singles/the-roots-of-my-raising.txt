[Verse 1]
I left the four-lane highway, took a blacktop seven miles
Down by the old country school I went to as a child
Two miles down a gravel road, I could see the proud old home
A tribute to a way of life that's almost come and gone

[Chorus]
The roots of my raising run deep
I've come back for the strength that I need
And hope comes, no matter how far down I sink
The roots of my raising run deep

[Bridge]
I pulled into the driveway
Lord, it sure was good to be there
And I could see through the open door
That Dad was asleep in his favorite chair
In his hand was a picture of Mom
And I remembered how close they were
So I just turned away, I didn't want to wake him
And spoil his dreams of her

[Verse 2]
A Christian Mom who had the strength for life the way she did
Then to pull that apron off and do the Charleston for us kids
Dad, a quiet man whose gentle voice was seldom heard
Who could borrow money at the bank simply on his word

[Chorus]
The roots of my raising run deep
I've come back for the strength that I need
And hope comes, no matter how far down I sink
The roots of my raising run deep
The roots of my raising run deep
