[Verse 1]
You stayed with me through thick and thin
You watched me lose, you watched me win
You picked me up off of the ground
You never one time let me down

[Chorus]
And you put me on a natural high
And I can fly, I can fly

[Verse 2]
I was drowning in a sea of make-believe
As helpless as a falling leaf
You gave your hand to me that day
And you did it 'cause you're made that way

[Chorus]
And you put me on a natural high
And I can fly, I can fly

[Verse 3]
You always seem to let your feelings show
You love me and you let me know
Darling, just remember these three words
I love you, I love you, I love you

[Chorus]
And you put me on a natural high
And I can fly, I can fly

[Chorus]
And you put me on a natural high
And I can fly, I can fly
