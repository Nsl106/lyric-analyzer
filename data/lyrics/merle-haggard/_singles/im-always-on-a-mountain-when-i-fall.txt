[Verse 1]
Most of my life, I've almost been a winner
I've come so close, but never really won
Just when I thought I'd finally made it
I find myself back where I started from

[Chorus]
I hate to say I'm giving up, but I believe
Losing's just become a way of life with me
Losing wouldn't be so bad at all
But I'm always on a mountain when I fall

[Verse 2]
Then you came along and had me had me believing
For once in my life my luck had finally changed
And now you say you're gonna leave me
Seems everything I do winds up the same

[Chorus]
I hate to say I'm giving up, but I believe
Losing's just become a way of life with me
Losing wouldn't be so bad at all
But I'm always on a mountain when I fall

[Outro]
Losing wouldn't be so bad at all
But I'm always on a mountain when I fall
