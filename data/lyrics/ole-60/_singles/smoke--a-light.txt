[Verse 1]
Late night, wide awake
Layin' here alone
1 o'clock on the dot when I called
And she ain't pickin' up the phone
A couple hours later, get a call from her sayin'
That she'll be home in the morn
Says she's stayin' with some friends for the night and she's alright
But drank way too much to drive home, I should've known better

[Chorus]
Woah-oh-oh-oh, I don't wanna be home tonight
Woah-oh-oh-oh, anybody got a smoke and a light?
Woah-oh-oh-oh, don't you worry, don't stress that pretty head
I'll write some songs about whiskey and cigarettes and wishin' I was dead

[Verse 2]
And now shе's hot-breathin' on another man
Schemin' about what shе's gonna say to me
'Cause she knows I wanted more, but now her clothes are on the floor
And his hands are where my hands should be
And it's too late, or maybe it was fate
I should've seen it comin' all along
Because a good girl, well, she can only be good
Until all that's good is gone, yeah

[Chorus]
Woah-oh-oh-oh, I don't wanna be home tonight
Woah-oh-oh-oh, anybody got a smoke and a light?
Woah-oh-oh-oh, don't you worry, don't stress that pretty head
I'll write some songs about whiskey and cigarettes and wishin' I was dead
