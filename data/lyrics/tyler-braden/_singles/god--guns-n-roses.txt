[Verse 1]
She was sitting at a four-top with a few of her friends
Working off the work week, a couple drinks in
When that jukebox dime finally hit "Paradise City"
She was screaming every word like it was '87, hm

[Verse 2]
She caught me looking and laughing, singing along too
She just smiled and spun across the room
Made a beeline for the dance floor, pulling me by the hand
Telling anyone who'd listen, "This is my favorite band"

[Chorus]
Saying, "Oh-oh-oh, 'Sweet Child O' Mine's' alright
But have you heard 'Don't Cry'?"
Oh-oh-oh, she knew every B-side
And I just sat and let her talk all night
Thank the whiskey for the tipsy dance she gave me
Thank the couple Lucky Strikes left for my lucky streak
Thank the barkeeper keeping that patio open
Yeah, I could keep going
Thank God, thank God and Guns N' Roses

[Verse 3]
She told me her daddy wore out that two-side tape
That '81 Bronco had seen its better days
But it made it two hundred miles and we got a couple seats
Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door in the nosebleeds

[Pre-Chorus]
Hm, screaming like it was '87
Hm, that's when she said

[Chorus]
"Oh-oh-oh, 'Sweet Child O' Mine's' alright
But have you heard 'Don't Cry'?"
Oh-oh-oh, she knew every B-side
And I just sat and let her talk all night
Thank the whiskey for the tipsy dance she gave me
Thank the couple Lucky Strikes left for my lucky streak
Thank the barkeeper keeping that patio open
Yeah, I could keep going
Thank God, thank God and Guns N' Roses

[Chorus]
"Oh-oh-oh, 'Sweet Child O' Mine's' alright
But have you heard 'Don't Cry'?"
Oh-oh-oh, she knew every B-side
And I just sat and let her talk all night
Thank the whiskey for the tipsy dance she gave me
Thank the couple Lucky Strikes left for my lucky streak
Thank the barkeeper keeping that patio open
Yeah, I could keep going
Thank God, thank God and Guns N' Roses
