[Verse 1]
Somebody's at the front door
I can hear 'em knockin'
Your mama's on the phone and she feels like talkin'
There's chicken on the barbecue, barbecuein'
Don't worry about it baby just
Drop what you're doing

[Chorus]
'Cause they're playin' our song on the radio
Okay Mister D.J. atta way to go
A million watts of love power comin' on strong
Dance with me darlin', they're playin' our song

[Verse 2]
Oh, the house needs cleanin'
The grass needs mowin'
We both got places that we need to be goin'
Tomorrow's a big day
Better get ready
But tonight it's just you and me rockin' steady

[Chorus]
'Cause they're playin' our song on the radio
Okay Mister D.J. atta way to go
A million watts of love power comin' on strong
Dance with me darlin', they're playin' our song

Yeah they're playin' our song on the radio
Okay Mister D.J. atta way to go
A million watts of love power comin' on strong
Dance with me darlin', they're playin' our song

Yeah they're playin' our song on the radio
Okay Mister D.J. atta way to go
A million watts of love power comin' on strong
Dance with me darlin', they're playin' our song
