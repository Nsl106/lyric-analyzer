[Verse 1]
Love, I've been looking for a while
Been  close a couple times
Man,  she's hard to find
And towns everywhere along the map
Well, I've traveled there and back
And  I wonder where she's at

[Chorus]
Yeah,  maybe she's in Dallas
Cheering for the Cowboys
Maybe  laying low down in Mexico
I know she loves the sunshine
Yeah, maybe she's in Vegas
At a table dealing Blackjack
Hey,  if you wouldn't mind, if you see her out tonight
Tell her she's mine (Yeah, boy)

[Verse]
Life, it's a crazy ride, isn't it?
And I'm loving every minute
But it'd be better with her in it, yeah

[Chorus]
Maybe she's living in a small town
And she's taught to fear the Bible
But she's got a couple friends that she runs around with
Dancin' with the Devil
Maybe she's sittin' in a café
In a lonely, crowded city
Hey, if you wouldn't mind, if you see her out tonight
Tell her she's mine (Come on)

[Bridge]
Tell her I'm comin', I'm runnin'
Yeah, I'm sorry I'm late
That I want her, I love her
And I just can't wait to meet her someday

[Chorus]
Hell, maybe she's a hippie
Hangin' on the west coast
With flowers in her hair, probably doesn't care
'Bout nothin' but a good time
Maybe she's living up in New York
Working down on Wall Street
Hey, if you wouldn't mind, if you see her out tonight
Tell her she's mine

[Outro]
Yeah, tell her she's mine
Tell her she's mine
Hey, if you wouldn't mind, if you see her out tonight
Tell her she's mine
