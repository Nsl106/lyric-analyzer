[Verse 1]
Crack a bottle, pour another drink
Flicking cigarettes off in the sink
'Bout to kick it into gear and hit the bar
Took this shit too far that night and broke your heart again
Baby, I don't think I'll ever learn
Probably always had to crash and burn
It's like I love living in the flames
Swear I will, but don't think I'll ever change

[Chorus]
Girl, the same way Johnny loved June
Is the same way I'll be loving you
'Til the day them angels come through
Just make sure you want it, baby
'Cause I'm just like Johnny, yeah
I smoke that smoke to get high
Ain't nowhere close to walking that line
Stay three sheets gone and out of my mind
So make sure you want it, baby
'Cause I'm just like Johnny, baby

[Verse 2]
Ain't no doubt about it, I'ma let you down
I keep on wondering how long you gon' stick around
How many times have I put you through the rain?
And after all the hell, still ain't a ring up on that finger, no
Baby, I don't think I'll ever learn
You'll probably always have to watch me crash and burn
I always fall back in the same traps I've always been caught up in
Again and again 'til the end

[Chorus]
Girl, the same way Johnny loved June
Is the same way I'll be loving you
'Til the day them angels come through
Just make sure you want it, baby
'Cause I'm just like Johnny, yeah
I smoke that smoke to get high
Ain't nowhere close to walking that line
Stay three sheets gone and out of my mind
So make sure you want it, baby
'Cause I'm just like Johnny, baby

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Girl, the same way Johnny loved June
Is the same way I'll be loving you
'Til the day them angels come through
Just make sure you want it, baby
'Cause I'm just like Johnny, yeah
I smoke that smoke to get high
Ain't nowhere close to walking that line
Stay three sheets gone and out of my mind
So make sure you want it, baby
'Cause I'm just like Johnny, baby
