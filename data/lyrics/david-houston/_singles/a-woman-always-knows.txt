There's no lipstick on his shirt when he comes home
And he wonders if she knows that he's done wrong
She dried her eyes and she combed her hair
And she's smiling by the time he's there
Cause she's been lovin' just one man too long
She knows he's lyin' but she's tryin' tryin' her best to never let it show
That she's been cryin' cryin'
And she'll forgive him one more time but a woman always knows
She knows he's lyin'...
A woman always knows
