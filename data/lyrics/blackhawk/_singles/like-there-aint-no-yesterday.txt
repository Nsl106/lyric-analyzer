I been livin' my life like a man in chains
Ever since she took her love away
But this is now and that was then
And baby all bad things gotta come to an end

So tonight I'm throwing caution into the wind
Gettin' down to the business of living again
Back in the saddle and I'm holdin' the reins
Gonna find someone and love her like there ain't no yesterday

Well it's dark as a dungeon down where I been
And there ain't no way I'm goin' back again
I got my best foot forward onto greener grass
'cause there ain't no future living in the past

So tonight I'm throwin caution into the wind
Gettin' down to the business of living again
Back in the saddle and I'm holdin' the reins
Gonna find someone and love her like there ain't no yesterday

Out of the ashes, alive and free
No longer a slave to a memory
Got the rest of my life right out in front of me...

So tonight I'm throwin caution into the wind
Gettin' down to the business of living again
Back in the saddle and I'm holdin' the reins
Gonna find someone and love her like there ain't no yesterday

Tonight I'm throwin caution into the wind
Gettin' down to the business of living again
Back in the saddle and I'm holdin' the reins
Gonna find someone and love her like there ain't no yesterday
