Mona Lisa lost her smile
The painter's hands are trembling now
And if she's out there running wild
It's just because I taught her how
The masterpiece that we had planned
Is laying shattered on the ground
Mona Lisa lost her smile
And the painter's hands are trembling now

And the eyes that used to burn for me
Now they no longer look my way
And the love that used to be
Why it just got lost in yesterday
And if she seems cold to the touch
Well, there used to be a flame
I gave too little, took too much
'Till I erased the painter's name

Mona Lisa lost her smile
The painter's hands are trembling now
And if she's out there running wild
It's just because I taught her how
The masterpiece that we had planned
Is laying shattered on the ground
Mona Lisa lost her smile
And the painter's hands are trembling now

Mona Lisa lost her smile
And the painter's hands are trembling now
And if she's out there running wild
It's just because I taught her how
And the masterpiece that we had planned
It's laying there shattered on the ground
Mona Lisa lost her smile
And the painter's hands are trembling now
