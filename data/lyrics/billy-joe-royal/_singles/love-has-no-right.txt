Your hand was shaking
My heart was breaking
On that lonely night we said goodbye
I knew it was over
But you touched my shoulder
And I saw that teardrop fall from your eye

Love has no right
To let us fall
A-then break our hearts
A-love has no right
To push us together
Then pull us apart
Love has no right

I sleep without you
But I dream about you
And nothing could ever take that from me
And though I can't touch you
I'll always love you
Now and forever
I'll still believe

That love has no right
To let us fall
A-then break our hearts
A-love has no right
To push us together
Then pull us apart
Love has no right

Love has no right, yeah, mmm
Well, (love has no right) my, oh, my, my, well (pull us apart), mmm
Love has no right
Tell me can you hold on, well, well
Love has no right, mmm, baby, my, my, my, my, my, baby (pull us apart)
