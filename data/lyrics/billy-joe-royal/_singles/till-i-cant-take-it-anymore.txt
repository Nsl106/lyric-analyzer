Let's not fight it anymore
Unpack your bags and close the door
Girl, I'll never leave you

Though you lied right from the start
I can't convince my foolish heart
Not to believe you

You've got two good men strung out
And there's not the slightest doubt
That other men have loved you before

But you drew your face away
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell
Till I can't take it anymore

If I had one ounce of pride
I'd stand up or step aside
But I still love you
Mmm, hmm

So I'll accept the crumbs you drop
Cause I'm a fool and I can't stop or rise above you

Let him speak up for themselves
I speak for me and no one else cause I'm a beggar
Knocking on your door

But you do your thing so well
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell
Till I can't take it anymore

I'm too far gone to turn around
And pick myself up off the ground
And start all over
And over

Now one of us must win or lose
No matter which one you may choose you'll in clover (you know you will)

While you're making up your mind
I'll be praying all the time
Praying that you'll never let me go

But you do your thing so well
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell
Till I can't take it anymore

Mmm, you work your thing so well
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell
Till I can't take it anymore

Yeah, you do your thing so well
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell
Till I can't take it anymore
