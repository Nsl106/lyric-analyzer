You took all your possessions
The day you disappeared
There's nothing to remind me
That you were ever here

So why can't I forget you
Find someone else and just move on?
Why do I keep looking for you
When I know you've gone?

Out of sight and on my mind
Your memory's always with me
Like a shadow in the night
That I can't leave behind

Got a feeling that these feelings
Ain't never gonna die
And you're gonna stay forever
Out of sight and on my mind

Haven't asked our friends about you
I don't call you on the phone
I never drive by that new place
That you're now calling home

Cause baby, you're the last one
That I should wanna see
But I still turn each corner
Hoping you'll run into me

Out of sight and on my mind
Your memory's always with me
Like a shadow in the night
That I can't leave behind

Got a feeling that these feelings
Ain't never gonna die
And you're gonna stay forever
Out of sight and on my mind
