If you want
Something to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
Baby, my time is too expensive
And I'm not a little boy

If you are serious
Don't play with my heart
It makes me furious
But if you want me to love you
A-then, baby, I will
You know that I will

Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed
Let your conscience be your guide
But I know deep down inside of me
I believe you love me
Forget your foolish pride

Life is too short to have sorrow
You may be here today and gone tomorrow
You might as well get it while you want
So go on and live
Baby, go on and live

Tell it like it is
I'm nothing to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
But I tell it like it is
My time is too expensive
And I'm not a little boy
But I tell it like it is
I'm nothing to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
Tell it like it is
And I'm not your, I'm not your little boy
But I tell it like it is
