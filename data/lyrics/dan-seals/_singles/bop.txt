[Verse 1]
Put on your bobby socks baby
Roll up your old blue jeans
There's a band playin' down at the armory
Who knows what rock and roll really means

[Verse 2]
I want to ride in your '55 T-Bird
Drive through some old memories
I ain't after your body baby
I just want you to dance with me

[Chorus]
I want to bop with you baby all night long
I want to bop the night away
I want to make it a night like it used to be
When are hearts were young and our souls were free
I want to bop with you baby all night long
I want to bebop with you baby 'til the break of dawn
I want to bop with you baby all the night long

[Verse 3]
I got an old photograph in my pocket
When we were still in our teens
The Lord knows I feel a lot older now
But you still look the same to me

[Verse 4]
Honey you don't ever laugh like you used to
And I don't wanna see you blue
If you ain't busy tonight and you think it's alright
This is what I want to do

[Chorus]
I want to bop with you baby all night long
I want to bop the night away
I want to make it a night like it used to be
When are hearts were young and our souls were free
I want to bop with you baby all night long
I want to bebop with you baby 'til the break of dawn
I want to bop with you baby all the night long

[Bridge]
Lets twist and shout
Oh, just like in the good old days
And baby watch out
You know I just can't stand it
When you look at me that way

[Chorus]
I want to bop with you baby all night long
I want to bebop with you baby 'til the break of dawn
I want to bop with you baby all the night
I want to bop with you baby all night long
I want to bebop with you baby 'til the break of dawn
I want to make it a night like it used to be
When are hearts were young and our souls were free
I want to bop with you baby all night long
I want to bebop with you baby 'til the break of dawn
I want to make it a night like it used to be
When our hearts were young and free

[Outro]
(Bop with you baby, all night long)
(Bebop with you baby 'til the break of dawn)
(Bop with you baby)
(Bop with you baby)
(Bop with you baby, all night)
(Bop with you baby, all night long)
(Bebop with you baby 'til the break of dawn)
(Bop with you baby)
