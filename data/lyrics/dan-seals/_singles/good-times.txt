C'mon and let the good times roll
We're gonna stay here 'till we soothe our soul
If it takes all night long
Yeah, c'mon and let the good times roll
We're gonna stay here 'till we soothe our soul
If it takes all night long

I could tell ya....

The evening sun is sinkin' low
The clock on the wall says it's time to go
I've got my plans, I don't know about you
I tell you exactly what I'm gonna do

Get in the groove and let the good times roll
I'm gonna stay here 'till I soothe my soul
If it takes all night long
Yeah, everybody let the good times roll
We're gonna stay here 'till we soothe our soul
If it takes all night long

Yeah, it might be one o'clock, it might be three
Time don't mean that much to me
I ain't felt this good since I don't know when
I might not feel this good again

So everybody let the good times roll
We're gonna stay here 'till we soothe our soul
If it takes all night long

All night, all night
And all night, and all night long
Somebody said it might take all night long
And all night, all night long

So c'mon and let the good times roll
We're gonna stay here 'till we soothe our souls
If it takes all night long, yeah
So everybody let the good times roll
We're gonna stay here 'till we soothe our souls
If it takes all night long

And all night, and all night
And all night, all night long
Somebody said it might take all night long
And all night, all night long
