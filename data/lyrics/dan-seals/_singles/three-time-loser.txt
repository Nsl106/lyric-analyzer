I remember when I was back in school
The teachers always wanted me to learn the rules
But I was studyin' girls on Friday night
I said if I could learn this, everything's gonna be alright

You see, first time love, I was too young
Second time, I was left holdin' on
Third time's a charm, but I got burned
Three time loser will never learn

I grew up and I thought that things would change
Got more mature, but I guess we stay the same
But I still believe in a starry night
And I keep on waitin' for the one that will turn out right

You see, first time love, I was too young
Second time, I was left holdin' on
Third time's a charm, but I got burned
Three time loser will never learn

Been down one time
Been down two times
Been down three times, burned
First time loser, second time user
Third time, you'd think that I would learn
But I won't learn

Been down one time
Been down two times
Been down three times, burned
First time loser, second time user
Third time, you'd think that I would learn
But I won't learn

First time love, I was too young
Second time, I was left holdin' on
Third time's a charm, but I got burned
Three time loser will never learn

First time, I was too young
Second time, I was left holdin' on
Third time's a charm, but I got burned
Three time loser will never learn
