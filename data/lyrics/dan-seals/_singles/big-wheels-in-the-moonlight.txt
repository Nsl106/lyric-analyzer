I came from a town that was so small
You look both ways, you could see it all
All I wanted was some way out
Every evening I'd slip into town

And stand around by the caution light
And watch the big trucks rolling by
For me it was a beautiful sight
Big wheels in the moonlight

I had a case of wanderlust
I'd lie awake with the windows up
Out on Highway Fifty Nine
I could hear some big old diesel whine

She was going through all the gears
And headed out to who knows where
I fell asleep 'most every night
Dreaming about big wheels in the moonlight

And I want to put my life on the centerline
And I want to see the world before I die
And I know that there's a peace I'll never find
'Cause those big old wheels keep rolling through my mind

How I got here, it's hard to say
So many things got in my way
Can't complain about all I've got
Kids and a wife and a regular job

But at night when I'm sitting here
All alone in a living room chair
Sometimes I close my eyes
And see big wheels in the moonlight

And I want to put my life on the centerline
And I want to see the world before I die
And I know that there's a peace I'll never find
'Cause those big old wheels keep rolling through my mind

And I want to put my life on the centerline
And I want to see the world before I die
And I know that there's a peace I'll never find
'Cause those big old wheels keep rolling through my mind

'Cause those big old wheels keep rolling through my mind
