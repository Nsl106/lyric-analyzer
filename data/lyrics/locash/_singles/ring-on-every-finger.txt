[Verse 1]
I've got a pounding in my chest, baby
Feels like I'm 17 again
Have something burning a hole in my pocket lately
Done asked your daddy, done told your friends

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't gettin' down on one knee
Girl, I'm gettin' on two
Might be over the top
But I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do

[Chorus]
I'll put a ring on every finger
Just to show you I'm legit
Go on try my last name on girl
Just to see if it fits
If I could baby I would
Marry you a million times
Put a ring on every finger
Just to show the whole world that you're mine
Show the whole world that you're mine

[Verse 2]
Oh senorita, can't nothing be sweeter
Than you in that white wedding dress
Leaving that church in the limousine
Girl, why you crying, it ain't rocket science
All you gotta do is say yes
Spend the rest of your life with me girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know that
I ain't gettin' down on one knee
Girl, I'm gettin' on two
Might be over the top
But I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do

[Chorus]
I'll put a ring on every finger
Just to show you I'm legit
Go on try my last name on girl
Just to see if it fits
If I could baby I would
Marry you a million times
Put a ring on every finger
Just to show the whole world that you're mine
Show the whole world that you're mine

[Bridge]
Come on
Let's spend this life together
Dropping f-bombs like forever
With the whole world as a witness
Gonna flip that Ms. to Mrs
Gonna spend this life together
Dropping f-bombs like forever
With the whole world as a witness
Gonna flip that Ms. to Mrs

[Chorus]
I'll put a ring on every finger
Just to show you I'm legit
Go on try my last name on girl
Just to see if it fits
If I could baby I would
Marry you a million times
Put a ring on every finger
Just to show the whole world that you're mine

[Chorus]
Put a ring on every finger
Just to show you I'm legit
Go on try my last name on girl
Just to see if it fits
If I could baby I would
Marry you a million times
Put a ring on every finger
Just to show the whole world that you're mine
Show the whole world that you're mine
