[Verse 1]
Baby, do you ever wonder
Whatever happened way back when
Or if I'll see you again
And maybe if you ever wonder
Aw, you might wish things could change
I know this might sound strange but

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love with you
I didn't know it at the time
I know what I wanna do
It's makin' me lose my mind
I thought about thinkin' it through
And every time I do I find
I wanna make your dreams come true
I think I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you

[Verse 2]
Ooh, you are the power over me
You are the truth that I believe
You are my life, you are my world
You are thе air I'm breathin', girl
You are the light I wanna see
You'rе all of everythin' to me
You are the reasons that I am
Woman

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love with you
I didn't know it at the time
I know what I wanna do
It's makin' me lose my mind
I thought about thinkin' it through
And every time I do I find
I wanna make your dreams come true
I think I'm in love with you
Oh, I think I'm in love with you
I didn't know it at the time
I know what I wanna do
It's makin' me lose my mind, girl
I thought about thinkin' it through
And every time I do I find
I wanna make your dreams come true
I think I'm in love with you
Oh, I think I'm in love with you
I didn't know it at the time
I know what I wanna do
It's makin' me lose my mind, girl
I thought about thinkin' it through
And every time I do I find
I wanna make your dreams come true
I think I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you

[Outro]
I think I'm in love with you
I think I'm in love with you
I think I'm in love with you (Yeah)
I think I'm in love with you
I think I'm in love with you (Yeah)
I think I'm in love with you
