[Verse 1]
This love is getting kinda dangerous
Feels like it's a loaded gun
My mind, it's turning like a cloud of dust
My heart always wants to run

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
If you want a cowboy on a white horse
Ridin' off into the sunset
If that's the kinda love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet

[Post-Chorus]
White horse

[Verse 2]
Someday, maybe you could have your way
Right now's just not the time
Some things a man's just got to do
I wish you could change my mind

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
If you want a cowboy on a white horse
Ridin' off into the sunset
If that's the kinda love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yеt
No, I ain't there yet

[Post-Chorus]
Whitе horse

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
If you want a cowboy on a white horse
Ridin' off into the sunset
If that's the kinda love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl, I ain't there
If you want a cowboy on a white horse
Ridin' off into the sunset
If that's the kinda love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet

[Post-Chorus]
White horse
