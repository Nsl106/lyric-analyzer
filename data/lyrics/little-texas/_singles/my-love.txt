[Verse 1]
Get on your mark, get set
Ready or not, here I come
You've been looking for love
Well, honey, I can give you some
When your world is standing still, I can turn it around
Put your head up in the clouds and pick your feet off the ground

[Chorus]
My love
Are you ready for my love, my love?
My love, my love is ready for you
If you're looking for a heart that's always true
Only to you, then my love
My love, my love is ready for you

[Verse 2]
Girl, I've heard it said
That love is good for the soul
I see the hunger in your eyes
Burning out of control
My love is overflowin' from a lovin' cup
Girl, I know you're down, but love will lift you up

[Chorus]
My love
Are you ready for my love, my love?
My love, my love is ready for you
If you're looking for a heart that's always true
Only to you, then my love
My love, my love is ready for you

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
My love is overflowin' from a lovin' cup
Girl, I know you're down, but love will lift you up

[Chorus]
My love
Are you ready for my love, my love?
My love, my love is ready for you
If you're looking for a heart that's always true
Only to you, then my love
My love, my love is ready for you

[Outro]
My love, my love is ready for you
My love, my love is ready for you
