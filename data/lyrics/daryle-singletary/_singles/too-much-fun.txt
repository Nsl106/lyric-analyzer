[Verse 1]
Blue lights flashing in my rear view
The sheriff said, "Boy I should've known it was you
You got fourteen people in the back of this truck
I warned you twice, now I'm writing you up"
I said "Officer, what have I done?"
He smiled and said, "Boy, you're having too much fun"

[Chorus]
Too much fun, what's that mean
It's like too much money, there's no such thing
It's like a girl too pretty with too much class
Being too lucky, a car too fast
No matter what they say, I've done
But I ain't never had too much fun

[Verse 2]
There was a fight Friday night at the Stumble Inn
Me and Ol' Harley just had to join in
Next thing you know we were both seeing stars
They threw us out, closed down the bar
I said, "The Long Branch is open, the night's still young
And we ain't never had too much fun"

[Chorus]
Too much fun, what's that mean
It's like too much money, there's no such thing
It's like a girl too pretty with too much class
Being too lucky, a car too fast
No matter what they say, I've done
But I ain't never had too much fun

[Bridge]
I'm a holy terror, a tornado
Wind me up, turn me loose and let me go

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Too much fun, what's that mean
It's like too much money, there's no such thing
It's like a girl too pretty with too much class
Being too lucky, a car too fast
No matter what they say, I've done
But I ain't never had too much fun

[Tag]
No matter what they say, I've done
Well, I ain't never had to much fun
Give me the reigns and let me run
'Cause I ain't never had to much fun
