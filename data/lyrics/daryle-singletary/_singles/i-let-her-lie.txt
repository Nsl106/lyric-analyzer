[Verse 1]
She'd come home, 6 a.m
Tells me she'd been out with friends
And I let her lie
I let her lie

[Verse 2]
And in the glare of the morning sun
She swore I was her only one
And I let her lie
I let her lie

[Bridge]
'Cause the truth was too hard to handle
And I couldn't bare to lose that girl
We were that small town scandal
But she was my only world

[Verse 3]
One teary night she confessed her sins
But she vowed to never cheat again
And I let her lie
I let her lie

[Verse 4]
Though she tried Lord, she could not change
And I only have myself to blame
'Cause I let her lie
I let her lie

[Bridge]
'Cause the truth was too hard to handle
And I couldn't bare to lose that girl
We were that small town scandal
But she was my only world

[Outro]
The day I left no words were said
She was sound asleep on our double bed
And I let her lie
I let her lie
I let her lie
I let her lie
