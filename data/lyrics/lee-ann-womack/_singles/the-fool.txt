[Verse 1]
You don't know me
But I know who you are
Mind if I sit down?
Do I look familiar?
If I don't, well, I should
I'm sure you've seen me around

[Chorus]
I know that you've probably heard my name
Though we've not been introduced
I'm the fool in love with the fool
Who is still in love with you

[Verse 2]
If you've got a minute
I'll buy you a drink
I've got something to say
It might sound crazy
But last night in his sleep
I heard him call out your name

[Chorus]
This ain't the first time, he's done it before
And it's hard to face the truth
I'm the fool in love with the fool
Who is still in love with you

[Bridge]
I know love is a fragile thing
And I'm trying hard to make it last
But it ain't easy holding on to my dream
When he's holding on to the past

[Verse 3]
Just one more thing before I go
I'm not here to put you down
You don't love him and that's a fact
Girl, I've seen you around

[Chorus]
You hold his heart in the palm of your hand
And it's breaking mine in two
'Cause I'm the fool in love with the fool
Who is still in love with you
I'm the fool in love with the fool
Who is still in love with you
