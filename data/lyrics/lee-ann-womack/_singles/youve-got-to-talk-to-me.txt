[Verse 1]
How will I ever know what you're feelin'
How will I ever know what to do
If you simply refuse to tell me
What's goin' on inside of you
Have a little faith in me
Baby, can't you see
You've got to talk to me

[Verse 2]
How can I ever know how to help you
How can I ever know what to say
If every time your heart is hurting
You turn from me and walk away
Have a little faith in me
Baby, can't you see
You've got to talk to me

[Chorus]
No, you don't have to lie
Look into my eyes
There's nothing here but love for you
You don't have to feel alone
Let me share the load
There's nothing more I'd rather do

[Verse 3]
I'm the one you can always turn to
I'm the one who will stand by your side
My love for you is forever
You don't ever have to run away and hide
Have a little faith in me
Baby, can't you see
You've got to talk to me

[Chorus]
No, you don't have to lie
Look into my eyes
There's nothing here but love for you
You don't have to feel alone
Let me share the load
There's nothing more I'd rather do

[Outro]
I'm the one you can always turn to
I'm the one who will stand by your side
My love for you is forever
You don't ever have to run away and hide
Have a little faith in me
Baby, can't you see
You've got to talk to me
Have a little faith in me
Baby, can't you see
You've got to talk to me
Have a little faith in me
