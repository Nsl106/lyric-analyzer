[Verse 1]
If we have to wait forever, that's all right
If you say, "Let's run away," we'll leave tonight
I'd do anything you ever asked me to
Girl, the reason my heart's beating is for you and you alone

[Verse 2]
There's a price to pay for every choice you make
We'll have our day, no matter what it takes
I'll be there for you, whatever we go through
Girl, the reason life's worth living is for you and you alone

[Chorus]
Oh, you and you alone are with me from now on
Even if I ever see your face again
The love that you have shown is unlike anything I've known
We both know it's just a matter of when

[Verse 3]
I wish that we could just turn back the hands of time
And find a way to have your world fit into mine
I'll keep dreaming that someday it all comes true
Girl, the reason my heart's breaking is for you and you alone

[Chorus]
Oh, you and you alone are with me from now on
Even if I ever see your face again
The love that you have shown is unlike anything I've known
We both know it's just a matter of when
