[Verse 1]
You sure have a pretty smile, it sure has been a while
Since I've felt your touch
You've got the sweetest way, I think about you every day
And I miss you so much

[Chorus]
Oh, my pretty little Adriana
Are you lonesome tonight?
Oh, my pretty little Adriana
I'll find you when it all feels right

[Verse 2]
You're so soft and innocent, the sweetest night I ever spent
Was being held in your embrace
You're such a gentle soul, it's killing me to know
When will I see your face?

[Chorus]
Oh, my pretty little Adriana
Are you lonesome tonight?
Oh, my pretty little Adriana
I'll find you when it all feels right

[Chorus]
Oh, my pretty little Adriana
Are you lonesome tonight?
Oh, my pretty little Adriana
I'll find you when it all feels right

[Chorus]
Oh, my pretty little Adriana
Are you lonesome tonight?
Oh, my pretty little Adriana
I'll find you when it all feels right

[Outro]
Adriana
