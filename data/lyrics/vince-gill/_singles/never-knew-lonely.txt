[Verse 1]
No other lover ever really cared
When I've reached out for you, you've always been there
Now I'm so far away and, baby, I'm scared
I never knew lonely 'til you

[Verse 2]
You are my rock and the strength I need
To keep me sane in this life that I lead
Now I'm not with you and my broken heart bleeds
I never knew lonely 'til you

[Chorus]
Never knew lonely could be so blue
Never knew lonely could tear you in two
Never loved someone like I love you
Girl, I never knew lonely 'til you

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, I can't make up for the times I've been gone
I'll prove I love you in the words of this song
Back in your arms, girl, it's where I belong
I never knew lonely 'til you

[Chorus]
Never knew lonely could be so blue
Never knew lonely could tear you in two
Never loved someone like I love you
Girl, I never knew lonely 'til you

[Outro]
Never loved someone like I love you
Girl, I never knew lonely 'til you
