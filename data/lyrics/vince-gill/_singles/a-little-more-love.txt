[Verse 1]
We both went a little crazy
We both did each other wrong
Don't think it's too late, baby
Don't think that all hope is gone

[Chorus]
We need a little more love
To get us through the night
Just a little more love
And we'll be all right

[Verse 2]
It'd be easy to say it doesn't matter
To walk away and wish you the best
But I know we'd feel a whole lot better
If we tried a little tenderness

[Chorus]
We need a little more love
To get us through the night
Just a little more love
And we'll be all right

[Refrain]
We're gonna be all right

[Bridge]
Let's put our differences aside
We can make it baby, you and I
Let's give it just one more try
We can't let this thing die

[Chorus]
We need a little more love
To get us through the night
Just a little more love
And we'll be all right

[Chorus]
We need a little more love
To get us through the night
Just a little more love
And we'll be all right

[Refrain]
We're gonna be all right

[Outro]
Just a little more love
Gonna be all right
Little more love
Gonna be all right
Just a little more love
Gonna be all right
Little more love
Gonna be all right
Just a little more love
Gonna be all right
Little more love
Gonna be all right
