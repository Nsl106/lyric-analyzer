[Verse 1]
She was standing at the front door
When I came home last night
A good book in her left hand
And a rollin' pin in the right
She said, "You've come home for the last time
With whiskey on your breath
If you don't listen to my preachin', boy
I'm goin' to have to beat you half to death"

[Chorus]
Give me just a one more last chance
Before you say we're through
I know I drive you crazy, baby
It's the best that I can do
We're just some good ol' boys a-makin' noise
I ain't runnin' around on you
Give me just one more last chance
Before you say we're through

[Verse 2]
First she hid my glasses
'Cause she knows that I can't see
She said, "You ain't goin' nowhere, boy
'Til you spend a little time with me"
Then the boys called from the honky tonk
Said, "There's a party goin' on down here"
Well, she might've took my car keys
But she forgot about my old John Deere

[Chorus]
So give me just a one more last chance
Before you say we're through
I know I drive you crazy, baby
It's the best that I can do
We're just some good ol' boys a-makin' noise
I ain't runnin' around on you
Give me just one more last chance
Before you say we're through

[Chorus]
So give me just a one more last chance
Before you say we're through
I know I drive you crazy, baby
It's the best that I can do
We're just some good ol' boys a-makin' noise
I ain't runnin' around on you
Give me just one more last chance
Before you say we're through

[Outro]
Give me just one more last chance
Before you say we're through
