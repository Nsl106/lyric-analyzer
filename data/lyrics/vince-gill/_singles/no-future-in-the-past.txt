[Verse]
I lie here tonight in the darkness
I've never felt so alone
Tomorrow I'll wake up still lonesome
'Cause things haven't changed since you've gone
You walked out with angry words spoken
Your leavin' cut right to the bone
I'll pick up the pieces you have broken
Find the strength to go on

[Chorus]
I still remember how my arms once held her
How long do old memories last?
Why can't I forget it, can't I admit it?
There ain't no future in the past

[Chorus]
I still remember how my arms once held her
How long do old memories last?
Why can't I forget it, can't I admit it?
There ain't no future in the past
