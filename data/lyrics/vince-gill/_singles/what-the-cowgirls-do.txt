[Verse 1]
Have you ever been down to Texas, down around San Antone?
They love to go all night and treat you right and party 'til the cows come home

[Chorus]
I love it when they let their hair down and dance real close to you
You know I'm a sucker, baby, for what the cowgirls do (What the cowgirls do)
What the cowgirls do (What the cowgirls do)

[Verse 2]
They ain't no different up in Oklahoma, they ain't afraid to stay up 'til dawn
They love to cut a run and chug a lug, longnecks until their money's all gone

[Chorus]
I love it when they let their hair down and dance real close to you
You know I'm a sucker, baby, for what the cowgirls do (What the cowgirls do)
What the cowgirls do (What the cowgirls do)
Shoot that thing

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, there's cowgirls all across the country, from Baton Rouge to Bangor, Maine
It ain't hard to see they'll be the death of me, they're gonna drive my little heart insane

[Chorus]
I love it when they let their hair down and dance real close to you
You know I'm a sucker, baby, for what the cowgirls do (What the cowgirls do)
Well, I love it when they let their hair down and dance real close to you
You know I'm a sucker, baby, for what the cowgirls do (What the cowgirls do)
What the cowgirls do (What the cowgirls do)
What the cowgirls do (What the cowgirls do)
What the cowgirls do (What the cowgirls do)
What those cowgirls do (What the cowgirls do)
Mhm (What the cowgirls do)
(What the cowgirls do)
(What the cowgirls do)
What the cowgirls do (What the cowgirls do)
Mhm (What the cowgirls do)
What the cowgirls do (What the cowgirls do)
Mhm (What the cowgirls do)
(What the cowgirls do)
(What the cowgirls do)
What the cowgirls do (What the cowgirls do)
