[Verse 1]
We've been up all night long
Trying to solve a problem, hell, it's almost dawn
Ain't no time for sleepin' if our love is wearin' thin
'Cause I ain't givin' up, you ain't givin' in

[Chorus]
Don't let our love start slippin'
Love start slippin' away
'Cause the life we've been livin'
Gets harder everyday
Don't let our love start slippin'
Love start slippin' away

[Verse 2]
A wounded love walks a real thin line
And no communication will kill it every time
So open up your heart, baby, we can work it out
'Cause we've got the kind of love people dream about

[Chorus]
Don't let our love start slippin'
Love start slippin' away
Cause the life we've been livin'
Gets harder everyday
Don't let our love start slippin'
Love start slippin' away

[Bridge]
It's past the point of right or wrong
Let's find a way to just hold on

[Chorus]
Don't let our love start slippin'
Love start slippin' away
Cause the life we've been livin'
Gets harder everyday
Don't let our love start slippin'
Love start slippin' away

[Outro]
Don't let our love start slippin'
Love start slippin' away
