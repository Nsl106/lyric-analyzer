[Verse 1]
Everybody wants a little piece of my time
But still I put you at the end of the line
How it breaks my heart to cause you this pain
To see the tears you cry fallin' like rain

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me the chance to prove
And I'll make it up to you

[Chorus]
I still believe in you
With a love that will always be
Standin' so strong and true
Baby, I still believe in you and me

[Verse 2]
Somewhere along the way, I guess I just lost track
Only thinkin' of myself and never lookin' back
For all the times I've hurt you, I apologize
I'm sorry it took so long to finally realize

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me the chance to prove
That nothing's worth losing you

[Chorus]
I still believe in you
With a love that will always be
Standin' so strong and true
Baby, I still believe in you and me

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Baby, I still believe in you
With a love that will always be
Standin' so strong and true
Baby, I still believe in you and me
