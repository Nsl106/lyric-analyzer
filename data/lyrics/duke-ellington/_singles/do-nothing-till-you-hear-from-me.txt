[Verse 1]
Do nothing 'til you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream
Is over my head

[Verse 2]
Do nothing 'til you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance

[Bridge]
True, I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I've been untrue?
Though we're apart, the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you

[Verse 3]
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothing 'til you hear it from me
And you never will
