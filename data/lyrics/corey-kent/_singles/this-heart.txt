[Intro]
Yeah, ayy

[Verse 1]
I'm up to no good again
Burnin' through a second wind
Turnin' these doubles into nothin'
Tryna drown somethin' burnin' down in my chest
It's beatin' me black and blue, ooh
Like only goodbye'll do, ooh
Wish I could just drop it, but I got a problem
And it ain't even you, no, it ain't even you

[Chorus]
Damn this heart and everything that comes with it
Damn this missin' you every night feelin'
I'd rip it out, girl, if I didn't need it
If you're gonna break it, why don't you keep it?
It ain't doin' nothin' but keepin' me up
I can't help it, it just loves what it loves
It hurt like hell when you tore it apart
But I didn't know that it would take it this hard
But damn this heart (Mm-hmm)

[Verse 2]
It's like it don't understand
We're as done as we've ever been
Yeah, I wish I never felt it, nothin', I can tell it
It's draggin' me through hell and back again

[Chorus]
Damn this heart and everything that comes with it
Damn this missin' you every night feelin'
I'd rip it out, girl, if I didn't need it
If you're gonna break it, why don't you keep it?
It ain't doin' nothin' but keepin' me up
I can't help it, it just loves what it loves
It hurt like hell when you tore it apart
But I didn't know that it would take it this hard
Damn this heart
Damn this heart

[Bridge]
It's beatin' me black and blue, ooh
Like only goodbye'll do, ooh-ooh
Wish I could just drop it, but I got a problem
And it ain't even you, no, it ain't even you

[Chorus]
Damn this heart and everything that comes with it
Damn this missin' you every night feelin'
I'd rip it out, girl, if I didn't need it
If you're gonna break it, why don't you keep it?
It ain't doin' nothin' but keepin' me up
I can't help it, it just loves what it loves
It hurt like hell when you tore it apart
But I didn't know that it would take it this hard
Damn this heart
Damn this heart, yeah, yeah
