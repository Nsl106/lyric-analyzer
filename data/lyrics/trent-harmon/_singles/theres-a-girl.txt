[Verse 1]
There's a girl somewhere in Tupelo
Who's with a guy she barely knows
Who'd probably sell his soul for a kiss
There's a girl somewhere in Arkansas
Who's talking with a southern drawl
And a guy who can't stop staring at her lips

[Pre-Chorus]
And ain't it crazy
How they make us all so crazy?

[Chorus]
Why would we drive six hundred miles one way?
Blow through cash that we ain't made?
Get tattoos and wash our trucks?
Push and press our luck?
Why would we ask when we know we can't dance?
Show our hands and change our plans?
Lose our minds, break our hearts?
And learn to play guitar?
Why does any man do anything in the whole damn world?
'Cause there's a girl
'Cause there's a girl

[Verse 2]
There's a girl somewhere with eyes so blue
You know a call, it just won't do
So here I am on Highway 45
First girl to get me to ask myself
How I'd been with anyone else
Any other minute of my life?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't it something
How they get us doing something?

[Chorus]
Why would we drive six hundred miles one way?
Blow through cash that we ain't made?
Get tattoos and wash our trucks?
Push and press our luck?
Why would we ask when we know we can't dance?
Show our hands and change our plans?
Lose our minds, break our hearts?
And learn to play guitar?
Why does any man do anything in the whole damn world?
'Cause there's a girl
'Cause there's a girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't it crazy
How they get us going crazy?

[Chorus]
Why would we drive six hundred miles one way?
Blow through cash that we ain't made?
Get tattoos and wash our trucks?
Push and press our luck?
Why would we ask when we know we can't dance?
Show our hands and change our plans?
Lose our minds, break our hearts?
And learn to play guitar?
Why does any man do anything in the whole damn world?
'Cause there's a girl
'Cause there's a girl
