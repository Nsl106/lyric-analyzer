When the sun wakes up in the west
And lays it's head down in the east
When they ordain Madalyn O'Hair
And she becomes a priest

When a San Diego sailor
Comes home with no tattoo
When they put a dome on Wrigley Field
I'll be comin' home to you

But don't wait on me, little darlin'
Lord, can't you see, little darlin'?
I only go so far
There ain't no guarantee

Don't wait on me to win you
That's somethin' I just can't do
I never have and don't intend to
Don't wait on me

When the wind don't blow in Chicago
And L.A. is cold and clear
When they unfurl Old Glory
And no one stands to cheer

When my brother-in-law phones me
And the charges ain't reversed
When the cabbie don't want a bigger tip
I'll be slidin' home from first

And don't wait on me, little darlin'
Lord, can't you see, little darlin'?
I only go so far
There ain't no guarantee

Don't wait on me to win you
That's somethin' I just can't do
I never have and don't intend to
Don't wait on me

When you load up on a long shot
And you win by half a nose
When the Fourth of July parade
Is called because it snows

When the waiting room is empty
And the Doc says, 'Come on in'
When Christmas comes before New Years
I'll be comin' home again

But don't wait on me, little darlin'
Lord, can't you see, small darlin'?
I only go so far
There ain't no guarantee

Don't wait on me to win you
That's somethin' I just can't do
I never have and don't intend to
Don't wait on me

Don't wait on me
Don't wait on me
Don't wait on me
Don't wait on me
