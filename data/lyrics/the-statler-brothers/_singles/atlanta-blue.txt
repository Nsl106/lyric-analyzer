I'm dreamin' of you
And that makes me Atlanta blue, blue, blue

Just a name I remember
Just someone I used to know
Someone I never quite got over
A long long time ago

I'm Atlanta blue wishin' I could be with you
Summertime in Georgia
I'm dreamin' of you
And that makes me Atlanta blue, blue, blue

Don't wipe away my mem'ries
By makin' all my dreams come true
The way it was always seems better
So let me keep on missin' you

I'm Atlanta blue, wishin' I could be with you
Summertime in Georgia
I'm dreamin' of you
And that makes me Atlanta blue, blue, blue woo
And that makes me Atlanta blue
