I saw her from a distance
As she walked up to the wall
In her hand she held some flowers
As her tears began to fall
And she took out pen and paper
As to trace her memories
And she looked up to heaven
And the words she said were these...

She said Lord my boy was special
And he meant so much to me
And Oh I'd love to see him
Just one more time you see
All I have are the memories
And the moments to recall

So Lord could you tell him
He's more than a name on a wall..

She said he really missed the family
And being home on Christmas day
And he died for God and Country
In a place so far away

I remember just a little boy
Playing war since he was three
But Lord this time I know
He's not coming home to me

And she said Lord my boy was special
And he meant so much to me
And Oh I'd love to see him
But I know it just can't be
So I thank you for my memories
And the moments to recall

But Lord could you tell him
He's more than a name on a wall..

Lord could you tell him
He's more than a name on a wall..
