You're having second thoughts I can tell by the way you look at me
I can tell by what I see that you no longer believe in me
I'm havin' bad dreams can't seem to get back to where we used to be
Sometimes it feels like we're worlds apart
And I've got too much on my heart

I've got too much on my heart and I don't like to feel the pain
And I don't know where to start to make you love me once again
I don't have time to make you understand
Lord this thing is gettin' out of hand
Pain shoots through me like a dart and I've got too much on my heart

Don't be so cold to me I know you've changed but it's still hard for me
It's too late I realize I can see it in your distant eyes
You needed all of me but I can't be there like I used to be
And Lord it's tearin' me apart
'Cause I got too much on my heart

I've got too much on my heart and I don't like to feel the pain
And I don't know where to start to make you love me once again
I don't have time to make you understand
Lord this thing is gettin' out of hand
Pain shoots through me like a dart and I've got too much on my heart
