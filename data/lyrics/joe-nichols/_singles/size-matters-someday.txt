[Verse 1]
Someday she wants a big ol' house
Sittin' on a big ol' hill
And a mile-long tree-lined driveway
For her big ol' Coupe DeVille
Yeah, someday she wants a big ol' bank account
With too much to spend

[Bridge]
But right now
All she wants is a man

[Chorus]
With a big ol' heart
Who can love her like nobody can
Big ol' kisses that go on and on
And never end
With a big ol' smile
He'll fill her world with laughter
Size matters
Size matters

[Verse 2]
Someday she wants a big o' ring
With a big ol' rock that shines
And a big ol' walk-in closet
With shoes of every kind
Yeah, someday she wants a big ol' boat
She can lay around gettin' a tan

[Bridge]
But right now
All she wants is a man

[Chorus]
With a big ol' heart
Who can love her like nobody can
Big ol' kisses that go on and on
And never end
With a big ol' smile
He'll fill her world with laughter
Size matters
Size matters

[Chorus]
With a big ol' heart
Who can love her like nobody can
Big ol' kisses that go on and on
And never end
With a big ol' smile
He'll fill her world with laughter
Size matters
Size matters

[Outro]
Size matters
