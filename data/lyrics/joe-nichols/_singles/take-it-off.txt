If your feelin' that summertime heat
Got the top up on your jeep
Take it off, go on now take it off
Got the boat up on a trailer
Back it down in a river, take it off
Go on, now take it off

If the weight of the world's on your shoulders
Got a weaker words on your mind
Go on, do what you wanna do
Soak you up a little sunshine
Dig your hand down in a cooler
Grab a cold one and twist the top
Take it off, yeah take it off

Your a pretty little country thing
Bikini under them cut off jeans, take em' off
Come on mama take em' off
Them sunglasses on your head
Anything you don't wanna get wet, better take it off
Were jumpin' in take it off

If the weight of the world's on your shoulders
Got a weaker words on your mind
Go on, do what you wanna do
Soak you up a little sunshine
Dig your hand down in a cooler
Grab a cold one and twist the top

Take it off

Na na na na na (whoo hoo hoo)
Na na na na na

We can go fishing in the full moonlight
Get one on the line, oh take it off
Girl I'll have ya take it off
Got a blanket we can crawl underneath
If it gets to hot too sleep
We can take it off, baby we can take it off

If the weight of the world's on your shoulders
Got a weaker words on your mind
Go on, do what you wanna do
Soak you up a little sunshine
Dig your hand down in a cooler
Grab a cold one and twist the top
Take it off

Na na na na na (whoo hoo hoo)
Na na na na na
Take it off
Baby, take it off
We can take it off
Were jumpin' in take it off
